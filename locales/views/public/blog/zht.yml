        s1: "實習"
        s2: "累積你的經歷和人脈"
        s3: "今年夏天你有計畫要實習嗎？"
        s4: "在與你的學科背景和職業生涯規劃相關的行業裡實習，是一個用來測試水溫和深入了解你感興趣的行業之最好的方法。如果及早規劃，你可以每個暑假在不同的領域實習，逐步建立你畢業以後就業所需的技能。舉例而言，如果你畢業後想在廣告、公關或行銷工作，那麼每年夏天可以選擇在上述任一領域實習。"
        s5: "透過實習，你可以發現這個領域使是否真的是你興趣所在。如非興趣所在，你可能要在下學期選修別的課程，好探索你是否會對其他領域有興趣。如果這個暑假的實習證實了你的興趣所在和未來就業方向，那麼你在下學期可以選修相關的課程，來加強你在這個領域的知識和技能。"
        s6: "在申請工作時，不管你的成績好壞，實習經驗都會增加你被僱用的機會。你可以向潛在的僱主推銷自己，告訴他們你是既重實務經驗，也重理論的學生。"
        s7: "如果要在一個無薪但有附加價值的實習機會，和一個有薪但無附加價值的打工機會之間做選擇，你應該選擇那份無薪但有附加價值的實習機會，以大幅增加找到未來理想工作的機率。如果生活費是個問題，看你能不能與僱主溝通協調上班時間，好把兩份工作都接下來。就業市場競爭激烈，凡是能增加你個人市場價值的機會，你都要趁還來的及時，好好把握。"
        s8: "在實習期間，旨在學習新的技能，盡量把自己的強項發揮到極限，並在實習結束時，跟你的老闆要一封良好的推薦信，好做將來求職求學之用。"
        s9: "下一篇：找到第一份工作"

        s0: "作者：邁克史密茲 - 學生排行榜創辦人"
        s1: "文章"
        s2: "找到第一份工作"
        s3: "九篇短文 – 幫助你成功找到理想工作"
        s4: "幾年前，我經歷了求職的困難，最近又經歷了求才的艱辛，(在過去3個月內我僱用了18位主管)，所以我想寫這一系列文章，幫助你得到你的第一份工作。"
        s5: "現在許多國家都景氣差，如果你即將畢業，找到你的第一份工作是極其重要的一步。"
        s6: "為什麼這第一份工作這麼重要？不僅是因為它能負擔你的生活開銷，它還可以讓你從一個專業的環境中獲得寶貴的工作經驗。所有的高階職位都要求應徵者要有豐富的經驗，所以第一份工作是讓你日後得到好的升遷機會的起點。"
        s7: "讓我們先從遊戲規則講起。"
        s8: "由於全球化的關係，我們都在玩一場龐大的遊戲，這遊戲類似大富翁或象棋。"
        s9: "身為一個初學者，通常會有另一個玩家告訴你遊戲規則，或者你可以自己讀說明書，最多一個小時可以讀完。"
        s10: "不過，在這個求職遊戲裡，規則複雜許多，而且大家都很忙，你很難找到人為你解釋所有的遊戲規則。遊戲規模也不一樣，通常一局遊戲花幾個小時就玩完了，可是求職這場遊戲可以花上幾天、幾周、幾個月、幾年，甚至幾十年。"
        s11: "這場遊戲也缺乏透明度、反應與建議，所以要很快就得心應手很難。"
        s12: "以下六個遊戲規則教你怎麼玩，怎麼贏！"
        s13: "首先，這是你的遊戲而且你得獨自玩。"
        s14: "當然，可能有其他人願意幫助你，例如你的父母、朋友和昔日的教授，但最終它還是你的責任，你得作決定，並建立一個能讓你快樂的策略。"
        s15: "這是既可怕又新鮮的經驗，因為它給你無限自由，讓你任意開發自己的路，所以你應感到自豪，並學習如何玩好這場遊戲。這個新技能非常寶貴，而且能一用再用。"
        s16: "其次，這場比賽的所有行動都十分靈活。"
        s17: "你可以整天睡大頭覺，或花8個小時丟履歷表，或到高爾夫球俱樂部打工，交新朋友，或在家裡看流行節目。"
        s18: "你可以選擇主動接觸人群，或者你可以坐在沙發上，然後期待別人能發現你。我建議你嘗試各種可能，看怎樣才行得通。"
        s19: "第三，這不是場公平的比賽，而且沒有人監督你。"
        s20: "職場上可能有許多工作機會是年薪百萬，而且被僱用的大學畢業生成績普通，但這不代表每個人都知道這些工作機會。有時候求職者不敢向前跨一大步是因為他們缺乏知識或訊息，有時候是因為他們缺乏某些條件或技能。"
        s21: "這也意味著，你可能畢業成績很優秀但仍無法找到工作。"
        s22: "如果你還沒有掌握到成為一個獨立思想家和行動家所需的技巧，或尚未了解這場遊戲的規則，你的學術經歷則幫不上甚麼忙。當經濟環境轉變時，國家為了有更好的經濟表現，也會不斷地改變就。所以無論你所學為何，你也可以改變。如果你住的地方受到經濟、政治和社會力量的負面影響，那麼你應該朝遠處看，因為人類是天生的探險家。如果你的機會在別處，該是考慮搬家的時候了。儘管大膽地去尋找機會，而不是尋找風險，如果不成功，你隨時可以回到原點。"
        s23: "第四條規則很簡單: 你有自身價值。"
        s24: "身為公司的創始人，我知道永遠有工作需要完成，而且我很榮幸能與一個優秀的團隊共事，每天一同迎接挑戰並尋找解決之道。就像你的生日派對結束之後一樣，你很高興在你需要的時候，有少數幾個好朋友留下來幫忙善後。"
        s25: "這跟經驗或智力沒有關係，而是取決於態度。你願意工作和學習的態度使你價值不斐，你願意接受挑戰永遠是好事。如果你才剛從大學畢業，你所擁有的技能和知識剛好可以被用來解決許多公司目前所面臨的問題。"
        s26: "即使你經驗較少，有時候只要你在某個任務上願意比別人多花點時間，去了解這個任務，自告奮勇把它接下來，然後以專業的水準將它完成，則你只需要幾星期的時間就能成為這項任務的專家。我們會在下一篇po文再談談這個話題。如果你現在求職不是很順利，不要就認為你價值很低。當時機對了，合適的人選就會脫穎而出，此時如果你了解你的價值，機會就是你的了。"
        s27: "規則五: 你自己是一個公司，你得學習如何推銷。"
        s28: "在這個遊戲裡，你的公司有一個非常出色的員工，你得確保這個員工做些有用的事情，而且能學習成為一個專業人才。這個員工就是你的產品。"
        s29: "但不論產品多好，市場行銷和銷售是成功的關鍵。如果你的產品特色尚不明顯，那成功的定位能開啟機會的大門，並給你快速成長的機會。這是需要明確地分析市場的需求，客戶想要的品質，以及你的銷售策略。"
        s30: "除非你個人能提供出色的服務，且你的服務像史蒂夫賈伯斯一樣有很大的品牌知名度，不然沒有人會主動找上門。"
        s31: "你得推銷自己，讓別人容易發現你，然後以專業的方式積極地尋找機會。此時你正在我們的網站上閱讀這篇文章，就代表你已經開始了，這是聰明之舉。"
        s32: "但只在一個管道上出現是不夠的，你得找其他的機會，嘗試在一個專業的環境裡展現你的技能，最好是在未來的客戶或僱主面前表現，並且投資時間、金錢和精力來增強你的技能。如果你對推銷一無所知，可以到圖書館免費讀些相關的書籍，好找出你的銷售策略。"
        s33: "再來，你要如何聯繫僱主呢？你要如何讓別人容易發現你呢？你將如何使每個僱主都覺得你既特別又有價值？你將如何積極地尋求機會？推銷實屬不易，而且一個成功的推銷可能經歷幾周、幾個月，甚至幾年才能嚐到豐收的滋味。"
        s34: "規則六: 大多數的市場都受苦於供需不平衡，往往機會不是隱藏著，不然就是處於你熟悉的環境以外。"
        s35: "觀察這些供應現象就成了你的工作。很多公司都在找新人來幫助他們公司成長，但這些公司不見得都位在你所居住的城市。"
        s36: "你願意搬家嗎？願意的話，供應方會增加並為你打開新的市場，特別是如果你已經會說所需的外語。市面上幾乎沒有僱主願意支付你的語言課程 (除非你是一名足球員)，所以你願意投入時間和精力來增加你被僱用的機會嗎？"
        s37: "如果你有時間和一點點預算，盡量去上外語課程並取得認證，然後在面試時證明你的語言技能。付出的努力越多，回報就越大。"
        s38: "另一方面，你的客戶也有類似的問題，因為他想要僱用傑出的人才，可是很難找到一個有工作經驗、會講多國語言、又能接受普通薪水的年輕人才。"
        s39: "僱主也需要推銷他們的公司和品牌形象給你，而且他們時常投入大量時間、資金和精力，透過許多不同的管道，就為了推銷給你，但他們不見得會收到很多履歷表，而不太知名的品牌與規模較小的公司尤其有這樣的問題，他們會非常高興能認識你。"
        s40: "你應該主動接近他們，並幫助他們找到當地最優秀的人才 – 就是你。"
        s41: "這不只是技巧，也跟運氣有關。在過去幾天，為了一個職缺，我們收到許多申請表，都是天資與經驗兼備的人才，但我們已經完成了招聘過程，所以我們的重點已經從招聘轉移到用人把任務完成。所以不要擔心，因為有時候還是跟運氣有關，但如果你願意努力，你的機率會提高，運氣也會漸漸轉移到你這裡來。"
        s42: "使你成功的五個問題"
        s43: "這篇po文涵蓋了求職經濟學的基本遊戲規則。在下一篇文章中，我們將討論你該如何做準備，以專業的方法求職，並回答每一個畢業生想要求職成功的五個關鍵問題。"
        s44: "下一篇: 聰明的應徵者該準備好的五個問題"

        s1: "Blog"
        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Where can I find happiness?"
        s4: "It is important to understand the rules of the game and having read the first article of the series, you already know more than other graduates currently searching for their first job."
        s5: "To improve your chances of success even further, the following articles will help you in asking the right questions that will guide you in finding and getting the ideal opportunity. "
        s6: "Let’s start with the most important question first:"
        s7: "Where can I find happiness?"
        s8: "Before you start browsing job boards for opportunities, you should first clarify a few things about your character, skill set and expectations regarding the future."
        s9: "You could certainly just apply to a few hundred jobs online and see what comes of it, but in most cases your results will be limited and even if you take one of the jobs, you might still be unhappy with your choice a few months down the line."
        s10: "Let’s be more efficient and look at everything that makes up your personality."
        s11: "In the most basic terms, we humans are just a funny mixture of DNA that walks upright: Some limitations, likes and dislikes are imposed by our genes, while the majority stems from our environment and the experiences we had."
        s12: "In your case, you can certainly identify some positive and negative experiences that can help you identify your preferences when it comes to your daily work. "
        s13: "When did you last have a wonderful and highly productive day?"
        s14: "A day where you woke up in the morning, knew you had to do a lot during the day, then simply started working and accomplished everything?"
        s15: "Take your time thinking about it, we’ll be waiting."
        s16: "Okay, you found a great example."
        s17: "Most likely, that day included both more mundane and more challenging tasks and you can certainly identify the two. "
        s18: "Now at this point, most advice articles would tell you that you should simply look at the things you liked and did well and then find an environment where you could be doing this kind of task again and again, relying on your existing skill set to find happiness and be productive."
        s19: "We won’t be doing that here."
        s20: "In fact, you can even find happiness in doing jobs where you fail, hurt yourself, become frustrated with the next steps and feel totally clueless and inadequate."
        s21: "To be honest, these kinds of jobs are perfect for you if you want to really enjoy your life and keep on growing as a person."
        s22: "If upon your graduation you feel that your personality is fully formed and you are just looking for the right triangle-formed gap to put your triangle-formed personality inside, then you are missing out on the rest of your life."
        s23: "Even more importantly, the ideal job that suits your current skill set could well be a death-trap that will result in deep and lasting unhappiness further down the line if you stop growing as a person while working there."
        s24: "We are natural explorers and fitting yourself into a static and non-changing environment is something most people can’t handle really well. "
        s25: "Instead, we will use this perfect day to look at the skills you currently have and think about how you have acquired them."
        s26: "If you like working with people, then you most likely already have experiences working as a trainer for a sports team, a voluntary coach or just giving homework advice, you might have enjoyed baby-sitting for the neighbors or had a few experiences that generally put you into an interesting and responsible position close to others."
        s27: "On the other hand, your very useful Excel, mathematics and programming skills were probably also developed over a long period of time when you had to fight your way through tutorials, exercises and programming tasks, alone in front of a piece of paper or your computer."
        s28: "And after a few decades your skill set is simply the result of the things you did – not your genetic predisposition. "
        s29: "So where is the value in your perfect day, in that example we just discussed?"
        s30: "Going back to your job hunt and the way you can plan, you will find that this perfect day most likely was a day where you have been very busy, accomplished a lot and generally were not bored at all. "
        s31: "At the same time, most of the work you did was meaningful for you and you also learned something – whether you did the dishes or spent some hours working on a paper, the result was a measureable change in reality. "
        s32: "And that’s the key point of this first question."
        s33: "Happiness in your job depends on whether you can have this feeling of accomplishment, doing something meaningful, learning new skills while using some of your existing ones, being focused on the task at hand and ideally receiving an adequate compensation (Additional salary past a certain level doesn’t influence your happiness if other things are lacking)."
        s34: "So you are free to choose almost any kind of industry and role, even if your university education doesn’t match it perfectly, as long as the conditions above are satisfied."
        s35: "And this considerably widens the field: Many, many jobs provide inherent satisfaction and your degree doesn’t matter that much if you are willing to learn more: Whether you work in sales (Happy customers, the thrill of the close), in management (Analyzing structures, optimizing processes, making sure that people are happy) or as a specialist (Hours of focused work on a blue print or design, just you solving the challenge at hand)."
        s36: "Still, you might want to think about the fields and roles which are inherently interesting to you."
        s37: "Draw up a list of possible paths that fully fit your criteria, and also draw up a list of fields and roles that you would exclude based on a total lack of skills (e.g. chemistry, medicine), personal motivation (accounting?) and meaningfulness."
        s38: "Most importantly, think about the person you want to become and identify fields where you can learn the skills this person should have."
        s39: "If something seems slightly too difficult or out of your reach, then I would still advise you to include it on your list – this is exactly the kind of challenge that will make you grow, and ideally you will end up with multiple categories that are interesting for you."
        s40: "Why is this list important? "
        s41: "Because you will find that you lack a lot of knowledge and information at this stage."
        s42: "There could be twenty different options, and having more information about these paths would be highly valuable to you."
        s43: "This leads us to the next step: "
        s44: "Learning more about the opportunities that exist."
      blog_3:
        s0: "written by Michael Schmitz"
        s1: "Blog"
        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Which opportunities should I pursue?"
        s4: "I had about 12 different work experiences before I graduated."
        s5: "Apart from delivering newspapers and teaching English, I also worked as a secretary for a school, produced light bulbs in a factory, packaged sweets in a warehouse, trained children and adults in Taekwondo, was the night manager for a hotel, sold website design services, earned money doing data entry for the pharmaceutical industry, had an internship as a translator, worked in sales selling software licenses and did some consulting for a startup."
        s6: "And all of these experiences helped me in understanding the kind of challenges that employees and companies meet when trying to be successful in that industry."
        s7: "Going back to the earlier article about happiness, you already know a bit about certain industries, and are probably fairly clueless about many others. "
        s8: "This is perfectly fine. "
        s9: "There are thousands of options, and it’s impossible to know everything. "
        s10: "But if you want to find a great, well-paying job, then the first thing you might want to do is expand your knowledge base and understanding the existing industry is a key part of that task."
        s11: "Evaluate your options before you start applying. "
        s12: "A good application takes a bit of time, and after thinking about question one you should have multiple paths, roles and industries open to you – you certainly don’t want to waste time sending applications for jobs that are not worth your time."
        s13: "To make things easier, we can classify industries by their maturity."
        s14: "Are they growing, mature and stable or in decline?"
        s15: "Let’s look at growing industries first. "
        s16: "These hot and sexy industries are often centered around information, bio- and energy technology that require a certain skill set (currently highly in demand) from each applicant."
        s17: "These industries are highly appealing even if you do not belong to the group of engineers that design and build the products, but instead you could provide valuable services that help these companies become more successful."
        s18: "Whether you are an educator (run their kindergarten or support the management division), have studied psychology (metrics-based HR) or design (User interface design, layouts, process knowledge), your skills are in demand if you can adapt your current knowledge to the relevant requirements in that industry."
        s19: "Companies in this sector have the steepest learning curves – you will quickly learn about HTML, RNA and Betz CP values, and quite often there are many new concepts that are not even defined yet."
        s20: "The biggest advantage for you, career wise, lies in the freedom and the growth that is common in these industries."
        s21: "Freedom in terms of how to perform certain tasks - nobody else did it before - is coupled with rapid personal and financial growth if you succeed in providing value for the company."
        s22: "Quite often, salary schemes will be flexible and coupled to stock options, which might result in a lower base salary, but a higher chance to profit when the company grows."
        s23: "In addition, your chance to advance internally and within the industry is higher in growing fields, as turnover is generally higher and demand for skilled candidates large – not even including the fact that your success is to a large part dependent on your personal contribution."
        s24: "Startups and small- and medium sized enterprises can move quickly depending on market needs and your ideas, which is something that is much more difficult in larger companies."
        s25: "If you are looking for a higher-risk, higher-reward relationship to your job, join a startup in a hot field."
        s26: "You might even want to accept a lower salary initially to receive the chance to create your own role and position inside the organization – and to benefit further down the line when that company grows. "
        s27: "Stable and mature industries tend to be less exciting, but are a safer bet."
        s28: "Organizations active in them often have organized unions, regular work hours and a good or at least predictable entry salary and career progression attached."
        s29: "If you want stability for your family, then look for opportunities in these fields."
        s30: "Whether it is banking, chemistry, pharmacy, education (not sure whether that one will stay stable, especially at the university level), accounting, tax advice or certain types of engineering, you can expect a regular amount of turnover and opportunity."
        s31: "Most university courses and classes are tailored to provide you with insight into these kinds of positions and your qualifications should match their demands well."
        s32: "The largest disadvantage here is the size of the companies and the amount of bureaucracy and politics attached. "
        s33: "If you feel happy working in a regulated and predictable environment with limited freedoms, then this is not a problem – but please note that your career progression might depend more on the fact that someone above you is leaving than your own personal achievements."
        s34: "This leaves the declining industries."
        s35: "Don’t let yourself be fooled by the attractiveness of the hot and sexy growth industries – even if an industry might be in decline, your personal opportunity might still lie there."
        s36: "It can be very profitable to become a specialist in a slowly shrinking industry – especially if many people retire and few people are qualified to replace them."
        s37: "These industries are generally easy to recognize, especially if you have studied something related to that field: You might have been one of a select few students in your courses – a friend of mine studied in a course with just one other student, prompting the professor to change the lectures to cup-of-coffee talks in his office."
        s38: "However, you need to be careful to not end up with a skill-set that is not transferable when that industry shuts down completely. "
        s39: "You might also be surprised by the speed of the final decline, especially if you intend to work in a highly unpopular industry whose fate is largely decided by politics, such as nuclear energy, pharmaceutical or space technology (NASA/ESA come to mind)."
        s40: "If that declining industry is profitable, then you might still earn a good or even very good salary – but as the market is shrinking, the opportunities for advancement will become smaller and smaller."
        s41: "And don’t even think about rocking the boat – once an organization is dedicated to providing a certain kind of service (especially if it’s highly regulated as well), then your opportunities to be creative and to build your own path are extremely limited."
        s42: "Still, if you have a certain liking for older technologies or think you found an opportunity, then I can only suggest that you at least check out the options."
        s43: "At the very least, you will gain valuable experience and can always try to improve your transferable skill set (which we will discuss in another article) while you are on the job."
        s44: "You should analyze for yourself whether the industries accessible to you are growing, mature or in decline and whether entering one of them is worth your time and effort."
        s45: "Sure, you could earn money in all of them, but investing years of your life without growing personally and becoming more valuable doesn’t seem smart."
        s46: "Choose wisely and try to learn as much as possible."
        s47: "Ideally, you create a list of open questions which should be answered for all industries and opportunities. "
        s48: "You can then start finding answers to these questions by following the easy road: Look at the company websites, read industry reports and job reviews, and try to find additional information on the internet."
        s49: "An even smarter approach requires a bit more effort, but will yield much larger rewards: Speaking with the experts."
        s50: "If you are interested in an industry where your knowledge is limited, then informing yourself first via the existing sources and then moving into personal interviews is one of the best paths to take. "
        s51: "Sort all the information you have, then write down additional questions that are only answerable by someone who works or worked in that industry or role. "
        s52: "Once you have a list of 10-15 good questions, start looking for people in your network (see the network article) and reach out to them."
        s53: "Whether you speak with your parents, grandmother or your neighbors’ grandmother doesn’t matter, as long as your get to connect with someone who really knows the industry and is willing to help."
        s54: "And you will find that many people are willing to answer your questions if you are prepared, polite and focused on what you want to find out."
        s55: "Build yourself a list of contacts that could help you out, then write or call them."
        s56: "Simply ask for 10-15 minutes of their time to listen to their advice regarding your career choices."
        s57: "Even better, invite them for lunch (at their work or at a restaurant close to it) and meet them in person."
        s58: "If you are lucky, they might bring a colleague and you can build your connections within that company even further."
        s59: "You are going to work for the next 40 years or more, so investing a few weeks in this kind of information gathering won’t hurt – especially if it results in a great job offer and a happy and rewarding position afterwards."
        s60: "If you do this correctly, you will quickly have a good insight into the industry and roles that are available to you – which brings you to your next step: "
        s61: "What are your limitations?"

        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "What will you do for your career?"
        s4: "Upon my graduation, I had to make a life-changing decision: Do I want to work in Germany, close to my family, or move abroad to Norway, the UK or even Australia, possibly damaging my relationships at home forever? "
        s5: "Which countries are close enough to qualify as home, how much travel is too much? "
        s6: "Not an easy choice to make when you are focused on both enjoying life and building your career - with the economic necessity nowadays, a choice that many are facing."
        s7: "If you are about to select your first job, you might want to think about the things that constrain and anchor you."
        s8: "I knew that being abroad for a few weeks might be fine, but moving completely to the other side of the planet was too much for me – at least at that point in time."
        s9: "So I made my decision."
        s10: "This allowed me to greatly limit the search space for my career (Australia was right out, even though mining jobs are offering crazy salaries and benefits) and I looked at everything that was within a few hundred kilometers of my hometown, checking travel times, career opportunities and salaries and taxes and benefits for dozens of industries and offers."
        s11: "However, it is important to first widen your search space as much as possible, before you start introducing your constraints – in the last article, we spoke about the data gathering phase, and unless you know what kind of opportunities await a bit further ahead, it might be premature to close doors."
        s12: "But now that you know about the status of industries and roles globally, you can start filtering. "
        s13: "What are you willing to do?"
        s14: "Where are you willing to go, what kind of job are you willing to do?"
        s15: "Do you want to party or be home early every day?"
        s16: "Or can you go all-in, drop yourself into a 60 hour a week burn-out type of position (not necessary to burn out, but we talk about that later). "
        s17: "Are you willing to travel daily, weekly or every few months?"
        s18: "Do you think that your language skills might make you more valuable in other countries?"
        s19: "If yes, which countries interest you, and in which countries are you willing to move?"
        s20: "Especially as an EU citizen, moving abroad is fairly easy, but you might need to learn a new language and leave family and friends behind. Are you willing to do so?"
        s21: "This is not something you can do quickly and without discussions."
        s22: "Especially if you already have a family or want to move together with your partner, you might need to dedicate some time to this discussion."
        s23: "The biggest risk when moving abroad as a couple is not related to your own feelings."
        s24: "Instead, it’s the happiness of your partner that often suffers if the partner doesn’t have career options or a good social network."
        s25: "You might also want to discuss various timelines and think about your moves as an experiment."
        s26: "Just try it for a year and keep your options open."
        s27: "When you think about your constraints, you might also want to think about risks."
        s28: "What’s the worst that could happen?"
        s29: "Are you afraid of losing your position in the local soccer team (This is a common concern for many students I have met)? "
        s30: "Are you afraid of disappointing people that have come to rely on you to structure their day or that need your help with some tasks? "
        s31: "Could you end up stranded, lost and confused and with nobody to go to when you move to New York? "
        s32: "Certainly, there are risks, but not all of them have to be constraints."
        s33: "The correct way to handle risks is to analyze them: Find out whether their occurrence is likely (low, medium, high) and what kind of damage they would cause (low, medium, high, fatal)."
        s34: "What will you do to mitigate the damage if that risk becomes reality? "
        s35: "How can you minimize the chance of it becoming real?"
        s36: "In my job search, I spent a good deal of time thinking about what would happen if I didn’t like the town I moved too. "
        s37: "I want to bring my family?"
        s38: "If they changed jobs to follow me, would they be able to go back?"
        s39: "Analyzing this problem on the two levels mentioned above (minimize/mitigate) will help you in finding a good balance between constraint and opportunity. "
        s40: "It would be sad to close the door to a great chance because you overestimated a risk – or because you didn’t invest a bit of time in finding a workaround."
        s41: "As with many things, a professional approach will help you out here (hey, you are ready to become a professional, so start early!), so take your time in drawing a risk table for the various options and review it with friends and family.  "
        s42: "You will be surprised how many solutions you find – and be much more motivated to actually pursue the opportunities you really want."
        s43: "This review will leave you with a greatly limited list of opportunities, but most of these should be highly interesting."
        s44: "How do you now identify your priority in preparing yourself for these roles?"
        s45: "Our next article helps you find the best opportunity - quickly."

        s1: "Blog"
        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Why aim for the difficult jobs?"
        s4: "Nothing is worse than wasted talent – which brings us to the true story of Sandra and Mr. Badger. "
        s5: "Sandra just finished her B.Sc. in Business."
        s6: "She is a lovely young lady who, at 23, already has this relaxed and bubbly kind of character that makes her likeable at first sight. "
        s7: "She cares about the things she does – whether she is baking a cake or listening to a friend – she takes care and is nice."
        s8: "But now that she is about to apply for her first job in accounting, she begins to despair: There are only five entry-level positions open in her town, everything else requires a year or two of experience, which she obviously doesn’t have."
        s9: "And trying to be correct, she applies for these five positions – and only for them, which is quite sad for Mr. Badger."
        s10: "Mr. Badger runs human resources for a mid-sized soap manufacturer."
        s11: "He is 51, a grizzly veteran who worked his way up and who has seen quite a bit in his 30 years on the job. "
        s12: "A man who has seen both stellar performers (and quite often helped them get a chance to be stellar) and horrible failures (and quite often had to deal with the aftermath). "
        s13: "And right now, he has to clean up a bit – the department head from accounting just left and took two people with him to another company (producing gearboxes, luckily – not a direct competitor)."
        s14: "Filling the department head position is difficult enough, but finding someone to fill the other roles will also take some time: Ads are posted, and slowly, oh so slowly, a few applications come in. "
        s15: "Unfortunately for Sandra, the job offer she has seen required “a few years” of experience in accounting and “confidence in dealing with senior level executives” – and she didn’t apply. "
        s16: "For those in the know: Yes, accounting is difficult."
        s17: "And having a few years of experience certainly helps when compiling the books."
        s18: "So maybe Sandra did well in not applying for that role – but we will never know, because Mr. Badger never had the chance to review her application."
        s19: "But if he would have gotten it, he would have reviewed it."
        s20: "By hand. In silence."
        s21: "Especially after Sandra would have put a lot effort into writing a wonderfully matching application letter describing her experiences and why she would be a good fit. "
        s22: "And he would have seen that Sandra has been the accountant for her boyfriend’s soccer club and that she finished her studies with good grades and did an internship of six months already."
        s23: "That the tone of her letter was very nice, friendly and charming – and that she would like to talk a few minutes on the phone with Mr. Badger."
        s24: "And maybe they would have talked about the position and the expectations Mr. Badger has for that role. "
        s25: "And maybe, just maybe, Mr. Badger would have asked her about the accounting she did (you can bet your mouse that he would have), and he would have told her something about what would be expected in the role, and he would have told her that she could work her way up, and he would certainly have liked to meet her in person and introduce her to the colleague who now is alone in the accounting department."
        s26: "And then they would have met and her charm and experience would have convinced him. "
        s27: "Because honestly: One or two years of experience – stellar performers may catch up to this level in a few months, if they really care."
        s28: "And Sandra would have cared, because this is what Sandra does."
        s29: "Unfortunately, all of this didn’t happen, because Sandra never applied."
        s30: "And that’s sad, because Mr. Badger’s company would have been ideal for Sandra."
        s31: "But what could he have done?"
        s32: "Nothing, really, except lowering the requirements in the job ads, and then receive a lot of not-that-motivated application letters from people who don’t care."
        s33: "But you care."
        s34: "And that’s why you should prioritize your applications to apply for the difficult jobs first."
        s35: "If they don’t accept you, they at least have seen your CV."
        s36: "And if there is an entry-level position, they will likely tell you, because the same HR person is likely to know his area pretty well."
        s37: "There is another benefit: If you apply for the normal roles, you feel like this is an exchangeable opportunity."
        s38: "A start, an entry. Nothing more."
        s39: "But ah, the exceptional role? "
        s40: "That demands exceptional effort."
        s41: "And you are willing to go the extra mile (don’t write that on your CV – show that you are doing it!). "
        s42: "You will research the role. The company. The hiring manager, the HR person. And you will send them a nice email, asking for the right things (see that article), and maybe they will speak with you on the phone."
        s43: "And then you will either be a good fit for this opportunity, or they might offer you something else, but at least you are connected and you have a chance."
        s44: "And if that doesn’t work, and you went through all the advanced roles and applied for them, then you should have a network of decision makers."
        s45: "People you spoke with, people who like you and people who might want to hire you for another role."
        s46: "And you can still apply for the entry level roles."
        s47: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Prioritize the best things first – and aim higher than you think you should."
        s48: "And what happened to Sandra? In real life, she did apply and later became a managing director, leading a whole department of 600 employees at the age of 27."
        s49: "You could be another Sandra. But only if you care. And try."

        s2: "選擇外文系的動機與就業取向"
        s3: "各位同學們，"
        s4: "大家好！"
        s5: "我在幾個禮拜前認識版主惟中，與他相見甚歡，最近看到版上有人問有關選外文系的各種問題，我想以學姊的身份，給各位面臨選校的高中生以及已經在外文系的大學生們一點建議，希望大家覺得授用。"
        s6: "我畢業於交大外文系，ㄟ…已經畢業很久了，所以我不太清楚交大外文系現況，這篇文章也不是針對交大外文系，只是針對外文系一般而言，你在選系時的考慮以及未來的方向。"
        s7: "首先，我們來談談你會選外文系的原因，我能想到的有："
        s8: "A.	英文好，就是要念外文系"
        s9: "B.	英文好，分數夠，可以唸外文系"
        s10: "C. 英文不好，但分數夠"
        s11: "D. 比起其他的科系，比較能忍受外文系"
        s12: "可能還有其他我沒有想到的原因，但不重要，重要的是，你到底對英文或外文有沒有興趣，所以在此我就針對興趣取向來談。"
        s13: "如果你有興趣的話，外文系通常是英文系，除非像政大可以做到外國語文學院，然後下面有英文系、日文系、阿拉伯文系等。但是問題還是與興趣有關，再加上我只知道英文系，所以以下的例子都以英文系為主。"
        s14: "英文系教學內容大致分為："
        s15: "1. 語言學"
        s16: "2. 文學"
        s17: "3. 英語教學"
        s18: "4. 應用英文"
        s19: "5. 翻譯與口譯"
        s20: "1. 根據 Wiki, 語言學（英語：linguistics）是一門關於人類語言的科學研究。語言學包含了幾種分支領域。在語言結構（語法）研究與意義（語義與語用）研究之間存在一個重要的主題劃分。語法中包含了詞法（單詞的形成與組成），句法（決定單詞如何組成短語或句子的規則）以及語音（聲音系統與抽象聲音單元的研究）。語音學是語言學的一個相關分支，它涉及到語音（電話）與非語音聲音的實際屬性，以及它們是如何發出與被接收到的。"
        s21: "全文請看：http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E5%AD%A6"
        s22: "聽起來蠻硬的吧? 我當時是不怎麼喜歡語言學的，可使我有同學愛死了語言學，所以這真的是因人而異。"
        s23: "2. 根據 Wiki, 文學包括戲劇、詩歌、小說、散文，所以你會讀到莎士比亞的戲劇，Emily Dickinson 的詩，Jane Austin 的小說等，然後根據教授的研究方向與偏好，教授可能會先後讓你探索不同的主題，例如女性主義、後殖民時代、馬克思主義、後現代主義、比較文學等。"
        s24: "有關西方文學理論的介紹：http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A5%BF%E6%96%B9%E6%96%87%E5%AD%B8%E7%90%86%E8%AB%96"
        s25: "相對於語言學，我比較喜歡文學。"
        s26: "3. 英語教學，就是準備你畢業後去國高中當英文老師的，就我所知，師院和師大的體系出來以後是教小學的，所以這是兩者的不同。"
        s27: "4. 應用英文或實用英文，就是準備你進入未來職場時能用的順手或順口，不像語言學與文學一樣，在商場上是不重用的。但是這些學校通識課可能也有開，只是不是這麼有規劃或者有深度。"
        s28: "5. 翻譯與口譯，都是雙向翻譯，口譯則分逐步與同步，一個是你講兩句，停，我翻這兩句，停，你再講兩句，以此類推。同步是不停的，就像聯合國口譯一樣，我耳朵聽你講甚麼我嘴巴馬上翻，一進一出，超刺激的，所以注意力要特別集中，通常每個譯者都會有搭檔，一個人翻十五分鐘換下一個。"
        s29: "不是每個外文系都有提供這五項，但若有的話，大一和大二通常是以語言學與文學概論為主，好讓你決定你比較喜歡甚麼，然後上列3.4.5.是大三開始的選修，當然有外文系就叫做應用英文系，所以我猜語言學與文學比例會非常少。"
        s30: "但是不論你選哪一項就代表你畢業以後一定要朝那方面深造或就業。 (以下以項目號碼表達)，1.2.3.4.5. 出來都可以朝 1.2.3.4.5. 念研究所或就業，也就是我可以是文學主修，英語教學主修或副修，但我決定念翻譯究所，或者我主修翻譯，但我決定念英語教學研究所。就業方面也是一樣，我可以主修英語教學，畢業後決定不教書，而去商業做行銷。"
        s31: "你可以改變主意、改變方向，甚至畢業後朝跟這些完全沒有關係的行業去走。"
        s32: "再講下去，你會發現選擇外文系及主修和副修不只跟興趣有關，也跟未來就業有關。沒錯，畢竟我們還是要顧及現實，就是外文會是你吃飯的本錢，吃飯的工具，或者兩者都不是。讓我再進一步舉例。"
        s33: "a) 吃飯的本錢：就是像英語教學、未來念語言所、文學所等，你出來以後可能教國高中生或大學生。可是隨著台灣少子化，現在有多少學生需要多少老師，這種供需問題你要先查清楚。至於教大學生，碩士資格只能當講師，教授至少要有博士，代表你要有研究專長，定期發表論文，還要指導旗下研究生發表他們的論文或共同發表。你是走研究這一塊的料嗎? 你是教書的料嗎? 要想清楚。"
        s34: "但是翻譯與口譯比較不同。我在翻譯界做專案經理待過六年，我可以跟你講它的好壞處。好處是，一但你有穩定的客源，你的收入可以很可觀，甚至你如果是愛玩的話，可以每三個月就換一個地方住，尤其現在台灣護照通行多國，你可以在西班牙待個三個月，享受馬德里情懷，到紐約三個月體驗水泥叢林與慾望城市，到泰國每天早上潛水下午再開始翻譯，到法國體驗為什麼Gertrude Stein 會說 America is my country but Paris is my hometown."
        s35: "心動了嗎? :) 你知道要有穩定的客源有多難嗎? 你如果跟翻譯社合作，兩岸的譯者都被壓榨的滿慘的，且最近開放服貿，還不知道未來它對出版與翻譯的影響為何。你如果跟歐美的翻譯社合作，你可以收比台灣高2-3倍的稿費，可是你得非常有經驗而且在某些領域越專精越好，例如法律、醫療、機械，且你不可能只專精一項。或者你如果英文真的很好或在國外住過一段時間，那你可以專攻中翻英。"
        s36: "我認識有譯者以前是律師，後來到聯合國做翻譯，之後自己出來接客戶，後來跟某翻譯社合作，此翻譯社剛好法律方面的客戶很多，所以他在某年的三月單月就賺了三萬美金，因為他一天可以翻一萬字，一個字收 $0.10美元。你知道一般譯者一天翻多少字嗎？2000-4000字，而且收費還比他少一半。"
        s37: "b) 吃飯的工具：就是像外文系出來以後從商、理、工、法等等。以我個人而言，我大學畢業後到公關公司上班，後來出去年傳播所，畢業後進了翻譯頁，現在是國際創業的團隊一員，這禮拜四才在資策會舉辦的IDEAS Show 上台做了六分鐘的英文發表。當年我們班上有十個男生，大部分都是對英文沒有興趣的，現在 F1 先生在3M擔任專案管理，F2先生是台灣某科技公司駐上海的總經理。對我們而言，英文只是許多工具之一，能用得上的時候我們能用得很好。"
        s38: "c) 兩者皆非：就是進外文系只是一種手段、一個過程而已，其實興趣與未來就業都不是以外文為取向。除了上述兩位先生外，D先生在高科技公司就業，P先生在中華郵政，現在根本用不到英文，可是他們從一進交大外文就積極到資工、資科或其他科系修課，充實自己，所以即使他們不是資工或資科畢業，他們一樣可以跟本科的學生競爭。"
        s39: "如果你是屬於這一類的話，你現在不是在選外文系，而是在選學校，選哪個學校的其他科系是你有興趣的，以後多去修課，做副修、雙主修、轉系等等，但是轉系真的不重要，重要的是你學到了甚麼，有沒有學好。選好了學校，再選該校的外文系或其他你分數能上的系吧！"
        s40: "講到這裡，我們回頭看看不同的組合吧，這就是為什麼我用不同的項目編號 :) "
        s41: "現況："
        s42: "A. 英文好，就是要念外文系"
        s43: "B. 英文好，分數夠，可以唸外文系"
        s44: "C. 英文不好，但分數夠"
        s45: "D. 比起其他的科系，比較能忍受外文系"
        s46: "興趣："
        s47: "1. 語言學"
        s48: "2. 文學"
        s49: "3. 英語教學"
        s50: "4. 應用英文"
        s51: "5. 翻譯與口譯"
        s52: "就業，英文是："
        s53: "a) 吃飯的本錢"
        s54: "b) 吃飯的工具"
        s55: "c) 兩者皆非"
        s56: "我個人是A - 2&5 - b)，我有同學是 B - 1&3 - a)，我們班大部分的男生是D - 2 - c)。我建議你反向思考，從未來就業方向來取決，比較實際也比較容易。"
        s57: "建議至此歡迎大家評論、補充、發問，只是我不知道我是否有時間能一一回答。"
        s58: "如果你覺得這篇文章中用的話，希望你能按個讚、分享給你其他的同學，並抽空到我們的網站逛逛，建立個人檔案，讓我們幫助你從大一開始就增加自己未來就業的競爭力！"
