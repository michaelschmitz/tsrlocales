        s1: Prácticas
        s2: "Construye tu perfil y tu red de contactos"
        s3: "¿Vas a realizar prácticas este verano?"
        s4: "Realizar prácticas en un sector relacionado con tus estudios y tu carrera es una buena forma de conocer el terreno y ganar perspectiva sobre la empresa correspondiente. Si lo planificas con tiempo, puedes hacer prácticas en diferentes sectores cada verano para, poco a poco, construir las habilidades necesarias para el trabajo que deseas obtener una vez termines la carrera. Por ejemplo, puedes considerar hacer prácticas en publicidad el primer verano, relaciones públicas en el segundo y marketing en el tercero, de forma que, cuando te gradúes, estés mejor preparado para entrar en el mundo laboral."
        s5: "Gracias a las prácticas, sabrás realmente si ese es el área que más te interesa. Si no es así, quizás quieras estudiar otros cursos el próximo semestre para explorar otras áreas interesantes. Si, por otro lado, dichas prácticas confirman tus intereses y tu trayectoria profesional, entonces haz cursos que te permitan mejorar tus conocimientos y habilidades en esa materia."
        s6: "Cuando solicitas un trabajo, la experiencia que tengas en prácticas aumentará tus posibilidades de ser contratado, independientemente de las notas que tengas. Eso te ayudará a transmitir a las empresas la idea de que eres un estudiante práctico, además de conocedor de la teoría."
        s7: "Entre unas prácticas no remuneradas que añaden valor a tu CV y un trabajo de media jornada pagado que no te enseña nada, dale prioridad a la opción que añade valor a tu carrera y aumenta tus posibilidades de conseguir tu futuro trabajo perfecto. Si necesitas el dinero, acepta las dos prácticas e intenta llegar a un acuerdo con ambas empresas en relación a tu horario. El mercado laboral es muy competitivo, haz todo lo que puedas para aumentar tu valor."
        s8: "Y cuando estés en las prácticas ponte como meta aprender nuevas habilidades, maximizar tus fortalezas y obtener una buena carta de recomendación al finalizar."

        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "9 short articles that help you be successful"
        s4: "Having experienced the difficulties of the job search myself a few years ago and now knowing a bit about the hiring part as well (I hired 18 people in the last 3 months), I thought I would write the following series of articles to help you in getting that first job opportunity."
        s5: "The economy is tough in many countries and if you are just about to graduate, getting that first job is an extremely important step."
        s6: "Why is this first job important? Well, not only because it will pay for some of your bills, but even more so because it will allow you to gain valuable work experience in a professional environment. Advanced positions always require experience, so getting it now makes it possible to move to better positions later."
        s7: "Let's start with the rules of the game."
        s8: "Thanks to globalization, we are all playing in a great game together, which is slightly similar to Monopoly, Chess or Risk."
        s9: "As a beginner in these games, you either have another player read the rules for you, or you can simply do it yourself, which should not take more than an hour."
        s10: "However, for this new game, the rules are vastly more complex (there is a reason you can study business or economics as a full-time occupation) and it might be difficult to find someone who will explain all rules for you – people are busy. The scale is different as well. Normal games take a few hours to finish – this game takes days, weeks, months or years, sometimes decades."
        s11: "And while the winners and losers are easily visible in most board games, the lack of transparency, feedback and advice makes it more difficult to learn quickly."
        s12: "Six rules that will help you play - and win: "
        s13: "Firstly, this is your game and you play alone."
        s14: "Sure, there may be other people that are willing to help, such as your parents, friends and former professors, but ultimately it is your responsibility to play, to make decisions and to establish a strategy that makes you happy."
        s15: "This is both scary and refreshing, as it gives you the ultimate freedom to shape your own path. Be proud of yourself, and learn how to play well – your new skills will be valuable for you, again and again."
        s16: "Secondly, this game is incredibly flexible in terms of moves and actions."
        s17: "You could sleep the whole day or spent eight hours writing applications, you could take up job in a golf club just to meet new people or you could stay home watching whatever seems popular right now (Note: If you do what most other people are doing, then you will become like them over time)."
        s18: "You can choose to approach people directly or you can hope that they discover you while you are sitting on your couch. Try to explore what works and what does not, and become better over time."
        s19: "Thirdly, this game is neither fair nor supervised. "
        s20: "There might be hundreds of jobs that pay USD 100.000 per year for a young graduate who barely passed his studies, but that does not mean that everybody knows about them. Sometimes lack of knowledge precludes people from taking a great step forward, at other times it might be a lack of qualifications or sellable skills."
        s21: "This means that you might be an excellent graduate with good grades and still cannot find a job."
        s22: "Academic experience will be of very little help if you have not acquired the skills to be an independent thinker and doer or understand the rules of this game. Economies shift and countries constantly reorganize themselves for better economic performance. So can you – whatever you studied. If you live in a place that is negatively influenced by the economy and the economic, political and sociological forces at work, then it is time to look further. Humans are natural explorers, and if your chances are better elsewhere, then it might be time to move on. Go boldly and look for opportunities, not risk. You can always return."
        s23: "The fourth rule is simple: You have value."
        s24: "As a founder I know that there is always something that needs to be done, and I am proud to work with a great team that looks at the challenges and actively starts to solve them. It's similar to your experience when you finish your birthday party - you are just happy to have help when work needs to be done, and somehow very few people remain to help."
        s25: "Please note that this is not a matter of experience or intellect, but to a large degree a matter of attitude. Your willingness to work and learn makes you valuable, your willingness to tackle new challenges is always positive. And if you just graduated university you will already have a set of skills and knowledge that can be used or adapted to solve similar problems currently faced by many companies."
        s26: "Even if you have comparatively little experience, it will only take you a few weeks to become an expert on a specific task. This will happen once you know more than the others around you, take ownership of the task and complete it to a professional standard (which is a topic we will cover in the next article). Do not think that you are of lesser value because you had bad experiences during your current job search. The right person in the right place makes all the difference in the world, and if you understand your value, you will find an opportunity to contribute."
        s27: "Rule five: You are your own company, and you need to learn how to sell. "
        s28: "In this game, you own a company that is currently staffed with one bright person. Make sure that this person does something useful and can learn and grow into being a professional – this person is your product."
        s29: "But even with a great product, marketing and sales are absolutely crucial to your success. If your product is nothing special (yet), then smart positioning will open doors and will give you opportunities to grow quickly. This requires a clear analysis of the market’s demands, about the qualities clients want to see and about your sales strategy."
        s30: "Unless you are someone who offers an outstanding service that has great brand recognition (would you have hired Steve Jobs if you could? Why?), nobody will actually come looking for you."
        s31: "You need to put yourself out there and make it easy to be found, and then actively pursue opportunities in a professional way. Assuming that you read this article on theStudentRanking, you are already working on that, which certainly is smart. "
        s32: "But it’s not enough to be present on one channel: Look for other opportunities to be found, try to demonstrate your skills in a professional environment (ideally in front of future clients/employers) and invest time, money and effort into improving your skills. If you know nothing about sales, then read a few good sales books at a library (for free!) and create your own process."
        s33: "How will you contact employers? How will you make it easy to be found? How will you make yourself unique and valuable to each of them? How will you actively pursue the opportunity? Sales is hard work and a great sale can take weeks, months and sometimes years before it comes to fruition."
        s34: "Rule six: Most markets suffer from extreme inefficiencies – demand and supply rarely balance out and opportunities are often hidden or a bit outside of your comfort zone."
        s35: "It is your job to look at the supply part: Great companies are always looking for new team members that might help them in becoming better, but these companies are not always in your neighborhood."
        s36: "Are you willing to move? A yes here will increase the supply side and open new markets for you, especially if you already speak the languages required. Almost no employer will pay for your language courses (unless you are a soccer player), so are you willing to invest time and effort upfront to improve your chances?"
        s37: "If you have time and a bit of money available, take a course and get certified, then demonstrate your skills during the interviews. The more effort you put in, the greater your rewards will be."
        s38: "On the other hand, your clients will have a similar problem. They would like to hire outstanding candidates, but have problems finding multilingual 23 year old PhD’s with 5 years of work experience that are willing to work for an average salary."
        s39: "Employers need to sell themselves and their brand as well to you, and they often invest a lot of time, cash and effort into being present on many channels to do so. Still, they might not always get that many applications - especially smaller companies with lesser known brands face this problem – and they are grateful to get to know you."
        s40: "Approach them actively and help them to find the local optimium – you."
        s41: "This is not just a matter of skill, but also a matter of luck: We received some great applications from very talented and experienced people during the last few days for a new position, but at that point we already completed the hiring process (and spent our budget) and our focus moved from hiring to getting things done again. So do not worry too much – luck plays a role, but if you put enough effort and love into it, the numbers will become higher and luck moves to your side of the table."
        s42: "5 questions that will make you successful"
        s43: "This covers some of the ground rules for the job search economics game. In the next article we will discuss how you can prepare yourself professionally for that search and answer the five key questions every graduate should have answered to be successful when it comes to the job market."

        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Where can I find happiness?"
        s4: "It is important to understand the rules of the game and having read the first article of the series, you already know more than other graduates currently searching for their first job."
        s5: "To improve your chances of success even further, the following articles will help you in asking the right questions that will guide you in finding and getting the ideal opportunity. "
        s6: "Let’s start with the most important question first:"
        s7: "Where can I find happiness?"
        s8: "Before you start browsing job boards for opportunities, you should first clarify a few things about your character, skill set and expectations regarding the future."
        s9: "You could certainly just apply to a few hundred jobs online and see what comes of it, but in most cases your results will be limited and even if you take one of the jobs, you might still be unhappy with your choice a few months down the line."
        s10: "Let’s be more efficient and look at everything that makes up your personality."
        s11: "In the most basic terms, we humans are just a funny mixture of DNA that walks upright: Some limitations, likes and dislikes are imposed by our genes, while the majority stems from our environment and the experiences we had."
        s12: "In your case, you can certainly identify some positive and negative experiences that can help you identify your preferences when it comes to your daily work. "
        s13: "When did you last have a wonderful and highly productive day?"
        s14: "A day where you woke up in the morning, knew you had to do a lot during the day, then simply started working and accomplished everything?"
        s15: "Take your time thinking about it, we’ll be waiting."
        s16: "Okay, you found a great example."
        s17: "Most likely, that day included both more mundane and more challenging tasks and you can certainly identify the two. "
        s18: "Now at this point, most advice articles would tell you that you should simply look at the things you liked and did well and then find an environment where you could be doing this kind of task again and again, relying on your existing skill set to find happiness and be productive."
        s19: "We won’t be doing that here."
        s20: "In fact, you can even find happiness in doing jobs where you fail, hurt yourself, become frustrated with the next steps and feel totally clueless and inadequate."
        s21: "To be honest, these kinds of jobs are perfect for you if you want to really enjoy your life and keep on growing as a person."
        s22: "If upon your graduation you feel that your personality is fully formed and you are just looking for the right triangle-formed gap to put your triangle-formed personality inside, then you are missing out on the rest of your life."
        s23: "Even more importantly, the ideal job that suits your current skill set could well be a death-trap that will result in deep and lasting unhappiness further down the line if you stop growing as a person while working there."
        s24: "We are natural explorers and fitting yourself into a static and non-changing environment is something most people can’t handle really well. "
        s25: "Instead, we will use this perfect day to look at the skills you currently have and think about how you have acquired them."
        s26: "If you like working with people, then you most likely already have experiences working as a trainer for a sports team, a voluntary coach or just giving homework advice, you might have enjoyed baby-sitting for the neighbors or had a few experiences that generally put you into an interesting and responsible position close to others."
        s27: "On the other hand, your very useful Excel, mathematics and programming skills were probably also developed over a long period of time when you had to fight your way through tutorials, exercises and programming tasks, alone in front of a piece of paper or your computer."
        s28: "And after a few decades your skill set is simply the result of the things you did – not your genetic predisposition. "
        s29: "So where is the value in your perfect day, in that example we just discussed?"
        s30: "Going back to your job hunt and the way you can plan, you will find that this perfect day most likely was a day where you have been very busy, accomplished a lot and generally were not bored at all. "
        s31: "At the same time, most of the work you did was meaningful for you and you also learned something – whether you did the dishes or spent some hours working on a paper, the result was a measureable change in reality. "
        s32: "And that’s the key point of this first question."
        s33: "Happiness in your job depends on whether you can have this feeling of accomplishment, doing something meaningful, learning new skills while using some of your existing ones, being focused on the task at hand and ideally receiving an adequate compensation (Additional salary past a certain level doesn’t influence your happiness if other things are lacking)."
        s34: "So you are free to choose almost any kind of industry and role, even if your university education doesn’t match it perfectly, as long as the conditions above are satisfied."
        s35: "And this considerably widens the field: Many, many jobs provide inherent satisfaction and your degree doesn’t matter that much if you are willing to learn more: Whether you work in sales (Happy customers, the thrill of the close), in management (Analyzing structures, optimizing processes, making sure that people are happy) or as a specialist (Hours of focused work on a blue print or design, just you solving the challenge at hand)."
        s36: "Still, you might want to think about the fields and roles which are inherently interesting to you."
        s37: "Draw up a list of possible paths that fully fit your criteria, and also draw up a list of fields and roles that you would exclude based on a total lack of skills (e.g. chemistry, medicine), personal motivation (accounting?) and meaningfulness."
        s38: "Most importantly, think about the person you want to become and identify fields where you can learn the skills this person should have."
        s39: "If something seems slightly too difficult or out of your reach, then I would still advise you to include it on your list – this is exactly the kind of challenge that will make you grow, and ideally you will end up with multiple categories that are interesting for you."
        s40: "Why is this list important? "
        s41: "Because you will find that you lack a lot of knowledge and information at this stage."
        s42: "There could be twenty different options, and having more information about these paths would be highly valuable to you."
        s43: "This leads us to the next step: "
        s44: "Learning more about the opportunities that exist."

        s1: "Blog"
        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Which opportunities should I pursue?"
        s4: "I had about 12 different work experiences before I graduated."
        s5: "Apart from delivering newspapers and teaching English, I also worked as a secretary for a school, produced light bulbs in a factory, packaged sweets in a warehouse, trained children and adults in Taekwondo, was the night manager for a hotel, sold website design services, earned money doing data entry for the pharmaceutical industry, had an internship as a translator, worked in sales selling software licenses and did some consulting for a startup."
        s6: "And all of these experiences helped me in understanding the kind of challenges that employees and companies meet when trying to be successful in that industry."
        s7: "Going back to the earlier article about happiness, you already know a bit about certain industries, and are probably fairly clueless about many others. "
        s8: "This is perfectly fine. "
        s9: "There are thousands of options, and it’s impossible to know everything. "
        s10: "But if you want to find a great, well-paying job, then the first thing you might want to do is expand your knowledge base and understanding the existing industry is a key part of that task."
        s11: "Evaluate your options before you start applying. "
        s12: "A good application takes a bit of time, and after thinking about question one you should have multiple paths, roles and industries open to you – you certainly don’t want to waste time sending applications for jobs that are not worth your time."
        s13: "To make things easier, we can classify industries by their maturity."
        s14: "Are they growing, mature and stable or in decline?"
        s15: "Let’s look at growing industries first. "
        s16: "These hot and sexy industries are often centered around information, bio- and energy technology that require a certain skill set (currently highly in demand) from each applicant."
        s17: "These industries are highly appealing even if you do not belong to the group of engineers that design and build the products, but instead you could provide valuable services that help these companies become more successful."
        s18: "Whether you are an educator (run their kindergarten or support the management division), have studied psychology (metrics-based HR) or design (User interface design, layouts, process knowledge), your skills are in demand if you can adapt your current knowledge to the relevant requirements in that industry."
        s19: "Companies in this sector have the steepest learning curves – you will quickly learn about HTML, RNA and Betz CP values, and quite often there are many new concepts that are not even defined yet."
        s20: "The biggest advantage for you, career wise, lies in the freedom and the growth that is common in these industries."
        s21: "Freedom in terms of how to perform certain tasks - nobody else did it before - is coupled with rapid personal and financial growth if you succeed in providing value for the company."
        s22: "Quite often, salary schemes will be flexible and coupled to stock options, which might result in a lower base salary, but a higher chance to profit when the company grows."
        s23: "In addition, your chance to advance internally and within the industry is higher in growing fields, as turnover is generally higher and demand for skilled candidates large – not even including the fact that your success is to a large part dependent on your personal contribution."
        s24: "Startups and small- and medium sized enterprises can move quickly depending on market needs and your ideas, which is something that is much more difficult in larger companies."
        s25: "If you are looking for a higher-risk, higher-reward relationship to your job, join a startup in a hot field."
        s26: "You might even want to accept a lower salary initially to receive the chance to create your own role and position inside the organization – and to benefit further down the line when that company grows. "
        s27: "Stable and mature industries tend to be less exciting, but are a safer bet."
        s28: "Organizations active in them often have organized unions, regular work hours and a good or at least predictable entry salary and career progression attached."
        s29: "If you want stability for your family, then look for opportunities in these fields."
        s30: "Whether it is banking, chemistry, pharmacy, education (not sure whether that one will stay stable, especially at the university level), accounting, tax advice or certain types of engineering, you can expect a regular amount of turnover and opportunity."
        s31: "Most university courses and classes are tailored to provide you with insight into these kinds of positions and your qualifications should match their demands well."
        s32: "The largest disadvantage here is the size of the companies and the amount of bureaucracy and politics attached. "
        s33: "If you feel happy working in a regulated and predictable environment with limited freedoms, then this is not a problem – but please note that your career progression might depend more on the fact that someone above you is leaving than your own personal achievements."
        s34: "This leaves the declining industries."
        s35: "Don’t let yourself be fooled by the attractiveness of the hot and sexy growth industries – even if an industry might be in decline, your personal opportunity might still lie there."
        s36: "It can be very profitable to become a specialist in a slowly shrinking industry – especially if many people retire and few people are qualified to replace them."
        s37: "These industries are generally easy to recognize, especially if you have studied something related to that field: You might have been one of a select few students in your courses – a friend of mine studied in a course with just one other student, prompting the professor to change the lectures to cup-of-coffee talks in his office."
        s38: "However, you need to be careful to not end up with a skill-set that is not transferable when that industry shuts down completely. "
        s39: "You might also be surprised by the speed of the final decline, especially if you intend to work in a highly unpopular industry whose fate is largely decided by politics, such as nuclear energy, pharmaceutical or space technology (NASA/ESA come to mind)."
        s40: "If that declining industry is profitable, then you might still earn a good or even very good salary – but as the market is shrinking, the opportunities for advancement will become smaller and smaller."
        s41: "And don’t even think about rocking the boat – once an organization is dedicated to providing a certain kind of service (especially if it’s highly regulated as well), then your opportunities to be creative and to build your own path are extremely limited."
        s42: "Still, if you have a certain liking for older technologies or think you found an opportunity, then I can only suggest that you at least check out the options."
        s43: "At the very least, you will gain valuable experience and can always try to improve your transferable skill set (which we will discuss in another article) while you are on the job."
        s44: "You should analyze for yourself whether the industries accessible to you are growing, mature or in decline and whether entering one of them is worth your time and effort."
        s45: "Sure, you could earn money in all of them, but investing years of your life without growing personally and becoming more valuable doesn’t seem smart."
        s46: "Choose wisely and try to learn as much as possible."
        s47: "Ideally, you create a list of open questions which should be answered for all industries and opportunities. "
        s48: "You can then start finding answers to these questions by following the easy road: Look at the company websites, read industry reports and job reviews, and try to find additional information on the internet."
        s49: "An even smarter approach requires a bit more effort, but will yield much larger rewards: Speaking with the experts."
        s50: "If you are interested in an industry where your knowledge is limited, then informing yourself first via the existing sources and then moving into personal interviews is one of the best paths to take. "
        s51: "Sort all the information you have, then write down additional questions that are only answerable by someone who works or worked in that industry or role. "
        s52: "Once you have a list of 10-15 good questions, start looking for people in your network (see the network article) and reach out to them."
        s53: "Whether you speak with your parents, grandmother or your neighbors’ grandmother doesn’t matter, as long as your get to connect with someone who really knows the industry and is willing to help."
        s54: "And you will find that many people are willing to answer your questions if you are prepared, polite and focused on what you want to find out."
        s55: "Build yourself a list of contacts that could help you out, then write or call them."
        s56: "Simply ask for 10-15 minutes of their time to listen to their advice regarding your career choices."
        s57: "Even better, invite them for lunch (at their work or at a restaurant close to it) and meet them in person."
        s58: "If you are lucky, they might bring a colleague and you can build your connections within that company even further."
        s59: "You are going to work for the next 40 years or more, so investing a few weeks in this kind of information gathering won’t hurt – especially if it results in a great job offer and a happy and rewarding position afterwards."
        s60: "If you do this correctly, you will quickly have a good insight into the industry and roles that are available to you – which brings you to your next step: "
        s61: "What are your limitations?"

        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "What will you do for your career?"
        s4: "Upon my graduation, I had to make a life-changing decision: Do I want to work in Germany, close to my family, or move abroad to Norway, the UK or even Australia, possibly damaging my relationships at home forever? "
        s5: "Which countries are close enough to qualify as home, how much travel is too much? "
        s6: "Not an easy choice to make when you are focused on both enjoying life and building your career - with the economic necessity nowadays, a choice that many are facing."
        s7: "If you are about to select your first job, you might want to think about the things that constrain and anchor you."
        s8: "I knew that being abroad for a few weeks might be fine, but moving completely to the other side of the planet was too much for me – at least at that point in time."
        s9: "So I made my decision."
        s10: "This allowed me to greatly limit the search space for my career (Australia was right out, even though mining jobs are offering crazy salaries and benefits) and I looked at everything that was within a few hundred kilometers of my hometown, checking travel times, career opportunities and salaries and taxes and benefits for dozens of industries and offers."
        s11: "However, it is important to first widen your search space as much as possible, before you start introducing your constraints – in the last article, we spoke about the data gathering phase, and unless you know what kind of opportunities await a bit further ahead, it might be premature to close doors."
        s12: "But now that you know about the status of industries and roles globally, you can start filtering. "
        s13: "What are you willing to do?"
        s14: "Where are you willing to go, what kind of job are you willing to do?"
        s15: "Do you want to party or be home early every day?"
        s16: "Or can you go all-in, drop yourself into a 60 hour a week burn-out type of position (not necessary to burn out, but we talk about that later). "
        s17: "Are you willing to travel daily, weekly or every few months?"
        s18: "Do you think that your language skills might make you more valuable in other countries?"
        s19: "If yes, which countries interest you, and in which countries are you willing to move?"
        s20: "Especially as an EU citizen, moving abroad is fairly easy, but you might need to learn a new language and leave family and friends behind. Are you willing to do so?"
        s21: "This is not something you can do quickly and without discussions."
        s22: "Especially if you already have a family or want to move together with your partner, you might need to dedicate some time to this discussion."
        s23: "The biggest risk when moving abroad as a couple is not related to your own feelings."
        s24: "Instead, it’s the happiness of your partner that often suffers if the partner doesn’t have career options or a good social network."
        s25: "You might also want to discuss various timelines and think about your moves as an experiment."
        s26: "Just try it for a year and keep your options open."
        s27: "When you think about your constraints, you might also want to think about risks."
        s28: "What’s the worst that could happen?"
        s29: "Are you afraid of losing your position in the local soccer team (This is a common concern for many students I have met)? "
        s30: "Are you afraid of disappointing people that have come to rely on you to structure their day or that need your help with some tasks? "
        s31: "Could you end up stranded, lost and confused and with nobody to go to when you move to New York? "
        s32: "Certainly, there are risks, but not all of them have to be constraints."
        s33: "The correct way to handle risks is to analyze them: Find out whether their occurrence is likely (low, medium, high) and what kind of damage they would cause (low, medium, high, fatal)."
        s34: "What will you do to mitigate the damage if that risk becomes reality? "
        s35: "How can you minimize the chance of it becoming real?"
        s36: "In my job search, I spent a good deal of time thinking about what would happen if I didn’t like the town I moved too. "
        s37: "I want to bring my family?"
        s38: "If they changed jobs to follow me, would they be able to go back?"
        s39: "Analyzing this problem on the two levels mentioned above (minimize/mitigate) will help you in finding a good balance between constraint and opportunity. "
        s40: "It would be sad to close the door to a great chance because you overestimated a risk – or because you didn’t invest a bit of time in finding a workaround."
        s41: "As with many things, a professional approach will help you out here (hey, you are ready to become a professional, so start early!), so take your time in drawing a risk table for the various options and review it with friends and family.  "
        s42: "You will be surprised how many solutions you find – and be much more motivated to actually pursue the opportunities you really want."
        s43: "This review will leave you with a greatly limited list of opportunities, but most of these should be highly interesting."
        s44: "How do you now identify your priority in preparing yourself for these roles?"
        s45: "Our next article helps you find the best opportunity - quickly."

        s0: "written by Michael Schmitz"
        s1: "Blog"
        s2: "Getting that first job"
        s3: "Why aim for the difficult jobs?"
        s4: "Nothing is worse than wasted talent – which brings us to the true story of Sandra and Mr. Badger. "
        s5: "Sandra just finished her B.Sc. in Business."
        s6: "She is a lovely young lady who, at 23, already has this relaxed and bubbly kind of character that makes her likeable at first sight. "
        s7: "She cares about the things she does – whether she is baking a cake or listening to a friend – she takes care and is nice."
        s8: "But now that she is about to apply for her first job in accounting, she begins to despair: There are only five entry-level positions open in her town, everything else requires a year or two of experience, which she obviously doesn’t have."
        s9: "And trying to be correct, she applies for these five positions – and only for them, which is quite sad for Mr. Badger."
        s10: "Mr. Badger runs human resources for a mid-sized soap manufacturer."
        s11: "He is 51, a grizzly veteran who worked his way up and who has seen quite a bit in his 30 years on the job. "
        s12: "A man who has seen both stellar performers (and quite often helped them get a chance to be stellar) and horrible failures (and quite often had to deal with the aftermath). "
        s13: "And right now, he has to clean up a bit – the department head from accounting just left and took two people with him to another company (producing gearboxes, luckily – not a direct competitor)."
        s14: "Filling the department head position is difficult enough, but finding someone to fill the other roles will also take some time: Ads are posted, and slowly, oh so slowly, a few applications come in. "
        s15: "Unfortunately for Sandra, the job offer she has seen required “a few years” of experience in accounting and “confidence in dealing with senior level executives” – and she didn’t apply. "
        s16: "For those in the know: Yes, accounting is difficult."
        s17: "And having a few years of experience certainly helps when compiling the books."
        s18: "So maybe Sandra did well in not applying for that role – but we will never know, because Mr. Badger never had the chance to review her application."
        s19: "But if he would have gotten it, he would have reviewed it."
        s20: "By hand. In silence."
        s21: "Especially after Sandra would have put a lot effort into writing a wonderfully matching application letter describing her experiences and why she would be a good fit. "
        s22: "And he would have seen that Sandra has been the accountant for her boyfriend’s soccer club and that she finished her studies with good grades and did an internship of six months already."
        s23: "That the tone of her letter was very nice, friendly and charming – and that she would like to talk a few minutes on the phone with Mr. Badger."
        s24: "And maybe they would have talked about the position and the expectations Mr. Badger has for that role. "
        s25: "And maybe, just maybe, Mr. Badger would have asked her about the accounting she did (you can bet your mouse that he would have), and he would have told her something about what would be expected in the role, and he would have told her that she could work her way up, and he would certainly have liked to meet her in person and introduce her to the colleague who now is alone in the accounting department."
        s26: "And then they would have met and her charm and experience would have convinced him. "
        s27: "Because honestly: One or two years of experience – stellar performers may catch up to this level in a few months, if they really care."
        s28: "And Sandra would have cared, because this is what Sandra does."
        s29: "Unfortunately, all of this didn’t happen, because Sandra never applied."
        s30: "And that’s sad, because Mr. Badger’s company would have been ideal for Sandra."
        s31: "But what could he have done?"
        s32: "Nothing, really, except lowering the requirements in the job ads, and then receive a lot of not-that-motivated application letters from people who don’t care."
        s33: "But you care."
        s34: "And that’s why you should prioritize your applications to apply for the difficult jobs first."
        s35: "If they don’t accept you, they at least have seen your CV."
        s36: "And if there is an entry-level position, they will likely tell you, because the same HR person is likely to know his area pretty well."
        s37: "There is another benefit: If you apply for the normal roles, you feel like this is an exchangeable opportunity."
        s38: "A start, an entry. Nothing more."
        s39: "But ah, the exceptional role? "
        s40: "That demands exceptional effort."
        s41: "And you are willing to go the extra mile (don’t write that on your CV – show that you are doing it!). "
        s42: "You will research the role. The company. The hiring manager, the HR person. And you will send them a nice email, asking for the right things (see that article), and maybe they will speak with you on the phone."
        s43: "And then you will either be a good fit for this opportunity, or they might offer you something else, but at least you are connected and you have a chance."
        s44: "And if that doesn’t work, and you went through all the advanced roles and applied for them, then you should have a network of decision makers."
        s45: "People you spoke with, people who like you and people who might want to hire you for another role."
        s46: "And you can still apply for the entry level roles."
        s47: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Prioritize the best things first – and aim higher than you think you should."
        s48: "And what happened to Sandra? In real life, she did apply and later became a managing director, leading a whole department of 600 employees at the age of 27."
        s49: "You could be another Sandra. But only if you care. And try."
