        s107: "Os seus resultados académicos demonstram uma abordagem disciplinada aos exames e ao trabalho."
        s108: "Descreva como se prepara e como aborda novos desafios (pf na sua descrição, não se foque demasiado nos resultados). As empresas procuram pessoas diligentes, responsáveis e motivadas. Os seus resultados demonstram estas caraterísticas."
        s109: "Excelentes capacidades linguísticas."
        
                
        s110: "Depending on the kind of industry and company, you will be a very valuable asset to any company. Learning a language does not only provide you with communication skills, but has also allowed you to learn more about different cultures and to analyse situations differently."
        s110a: "Advice:"
        s111: "Focus on your languages skills and the flexibility this provides for the company. Globally competitive companies prefer multilingual candidates."
        s112: "Many interests and skills"
        s113: "You have earned experience in many different situations and are used to dealing with new environments and topics. A broad set of knowledge and skills is valuable as it show that you are open to learning and mastering new abilities."
        s114: "Describe your motivation to acquire these skills. Why did you enjoy learning this? Passion is exciting, companies and colleagues would love to see you bring the same passion to your work."
        s115: "You have provided service to your community and engaged yourself in a good cause."
        s116: "Your efforts are recognized. You supported organizations in changing the world and have earned experience in dealing with setbacks and difficult colleagues and situations. You also have experience in motivating and convincing people - valuable skills for any employee."
        s117: "Extensive community service provides you with skills and experiences relevant to the daily work life. Present these experiences and your learning results. Which situations were difficult, how did you handle them? What would you do better next time? Which skills did you develop? "
        s118: "You have multiple publications"
        s119: "Your deep knowledge of topics of interest and polished technical or communication skills have led to multiple publications with your name on them. You invested time and effort into these topics and have become an expert already - this documents your perseverance and motivation to provide complete results."
        s120: "Publications are a credential to support your professional work attitude. Provide links to your publications and communicate the skills you improved during the creation and publication process."
        s121: "You received awards or prizes."
        s122: "Passion leads to performance. And your performance was recognized - whether this was an intellectual or sportive achievement, you have shown exceptional results and were lauded for this."
        s123: "Passion is important. So are results. When writing applications, mention your efforts and your motivations and draw a link to your new tasks."
        s124: "You received scholarships"
        s125: "Scholarships signal previous selection. Other parties have recognized a certain quality and decided to reward you financially or with support. Scholarships make it easier for future employers to find excellence - and you have earned your scholarship."
        s126: "You have worked hard to receive this scholarship and should be able to explain how this scholarship has eased your path a bit, while allowing you to focus on even better performance."
        s127: "You are doing great. Keep it up!"
        s128: Improvements
        s129: "Lack of significant work experience."
        s130: "Employers will treat lack of significant work experience as a risk factor. If you have never worked in an industry before, you might not understand or respect the work culture, the tasks performed by colleagues or your future job. There is a small risk that you will be disappointed by your daily work and will look to find other opportunities."
        s131: "Complete a few internships in relevant industries and test the waters. Even if you are not strongly interested, you can create an exclusion list and gradually form an opinion about the kind of industry you really want to work in."
        s132: "School grades were below average"
        s133: "Can't be changed. But this does not have to impact your future performance at work - if you are highly motivated to perform well, focus on the task at hand and prefer daily work life over theory, then you might sell yourself well to potential employers. This of course becomes more easy if you can also provide relevant internships and good certificates for the work you did."
        s134: "Focus on other, more important things and speak about the things that matter. Your interview partner knows how irrelevant your school grades can be for the position you are going to fill and is more interested in hearing reasons why you will perform well. Deliver these, ignore the past."
        s135: "Study grades are below average."
        s136: "You might still be able to improve these grades. Depending on the industry, employers will focus on your grades if the theory will be relevant for your future position. However, if you change industries, then having weaker grades should not be a problem - as long as you can communicate that they might be due to other priorities or lack in knowledge or ability in this field, and not a lack of effort."
        s137: "Bad grades should not limit you in becoming excellent in your work. Communicate this and tell your interview partner about your career plans and aspirations and how you want to achive them. Not everybody needs to be a double-degree PhD - certain jobs will actually benefit from a more practical hands-on person."        
      analysis_awards:
        s1: "Awards"
        s2: "You have not indicated any awards you might have earned so far. Awards are useful as they provide additional social proof about your abilities and motivation. You can earn them through sportive achievements or through competing in other fields that interest you, and quite often the experience itself is highly valuable on its own. Checkout the different competitions offered at your university: If you are a law, mathematics, physics, chemistry, business or engineering student, then you will find ample opportunities to enter competitions - and if your university doesn't offer or take part in any events in your field, then it might be a great time investment to join a national competition or set-up your own (this will also be highly valuable for your personal network)."
        s3: "Congratulations, you have received an award for your hard work. This award can be used to provide additional proof of your abilities and motivations for employers looking for talent. At the very least, the award shows that you are active in your field and, depending on the exact area, might also provide a positive insight into your hobbies and personality. Employers might bring the award up in job interviews to get you into story-telling mode. This is your opportunity to explain your thinking process, and the hard work you put into gaining the award. "
        s4: "Congratulations, you have received a prize after successfully competing in your field. This award can be used to provide additional proof of your abilities and motivations for employers looking for talent. At the very least, the award shows that you are active in your field and, depending on the exact area, might also provide a positive insight into your hobbies and personality. Employers might bring the prize up in job interviews to get you into story-telling mode. This is your opportunity to explain your thinking process, and the hard work you put into winning it."
        s5: "Excellent. You earned multiple awards through your hard work - and your time investment and determination will be recognized by potential employers. Having your awards visible is especially interesting if they are related to the field you are entering - and it's up to you to provide the linkage. You might want to mention your learning experiences and general mindsets that have lead to your success both in application letters and during the interview, as this provides a great opportunity to explain your thinking and attitude towards challenges to the recruiters. If you have a multitude of awards, it might be best to only provide the most outstanding results to avoid overloading the recruiter mentally - it takes time to process too much information, and especially when you are building your one- or two-page CV, ensure that you keep it easy to understand and validate."
        s6: "Very good. You earned multiple awards through your hard work - and your time investment and determination will be recognized by potential employers. Having your awards visible is especially interesting if they are related to the field you are entering - and it's up to you to provide the linkage.

      analysis_education:
        s1: "Education"
        s2: "Excellent - you finished your secondary education with high grades and are also doing well in your undergraduate studies. Apart from the knowledge you have acquired, you will find that the results you have earned through hard work and discipline will be valuable for your career, as recruiters often use grades as one of the defining elements in reviewing candidates. Think about it like this: When you receive thirty applications, then it is mentally and practically very easy to sort them by average grades. At the same time, it is much more difficult to properly assess the value of various skills and interests and to compare candidates on those factors. Are there more ways to benefit from high grades? Certainly. You might want to look for (additional) merit based scholarships or for the possibility to receive an award within your field. Your grades should also make it easier for you to open doors into companies, and, together with your knowledge, you might even already be able to cooperate with academics in your field on some publications. Success begets success, if you use it correctly. Concerning applications for internships and graduate jobs, you should make it easy for recruiters to understand not only the results you have earned, but also the formative experience you gained. Use your results to demonstrate how you think about new challenges and upcoming tasks, how you prepare yourself and how you deal with setbacks and new opportunities. You have worked hard and can provide proof of this with your results, so make sure you mention it in your application letters and during interviews. Some of your key selling points should be consistency and discipline, which are very important for companies, and your track record demonstrates that these attributes apply to you."

        s5: "Excellent - you have spent a long time within the education system and not only finished your secondary education with high grades, but have also been doing very well in your studies.

Success begets success, if you use it correctly. Concerning applications for internships and graduate jobs, you should make it easy for recruiters to understand not only the results you have earned, but also the formative experience you gained. Use your results to demonstrate how you think about new challenges and upcoming tasks, how you prepare yourself and how you deal with setbacks and new opportunities. Especially during your Phd, you have had ample opportunities to grow professionally. How have you overcome the challenges presented to you? What did you learn? Use example stories to illustrate the most relevant situations and then link this to the job you want to do. Another thing recruiters want to see is proof of  hard work - and your track record certainly is strong here. Make sure you mention it in your application letters and during interviews. Also, some of your key selling points should be consistency and discipline, which are very important for companies, and your degrees and grades demonstrates that these attributes apply to you."
        s6: "Excellent. You decided to invest additional time and capital into further business education and earned high grades during all of your academic experiences. As an experienced candidate you certainly already know a lot about the way interviews are conducated and about how to present yourself in the best possible light during the interview process. As you are already playing at the highest levels, your salary expectations and application material should match: Due to the number of experiences and results you had, it might be difficult to create a one- or two- page CV that makes all of your qualities visible in the best way. A suggestion here: Invest a small amount of capital to have your CV reviewed by two or three external agencies (after it went through the career services department), and practice your interviews three or four times with experts before you are going in. This will provide you with the optimal preparation and helps you outcompete others with similar qualifications."
        s7: "Excellent. You earned high grades during your studies and even during your secondary education. As an experienced candidate you know that your professional track record is key to your success, but at certain points gate-keeper will still look back at what you did academically. As of now, you might have eliminated further education from your thoughts and want to focus on your career, which is certainly viable. However, investing a small amount of time in a summer course or executive education can still pay off - not only in terms of the education as such, but more as an opportunity to meet other people with a similar background. Regarding the overall application process, you certainly already know which factors are the most relevant on your CV. Keep the education section short and focus more on your current and relevant achievements - you might have a long list to choose from."
        s8: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance during your studies. This makes it easy to show yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Even with all your other beneficial qualities, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. The advice here is simple: Keep your grades up during your studies and look for ways to improve your profile in additional ways. You will probably already make it past the entry barrier, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships are probably the most relevant factor here. Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for. During the interview itself, you can use the improvement in grades as an example to show how well you can perform and how you have trained yourself to always become better."
        s9: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance during your extensive studies. Ideally, you try to create a clear trend line of always improving grades from your undergraduate to your master studies. This makes it easy to show yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Why is this important? Even with all your other beneficial qualities, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. The advice here is simple: Keep your grades up during the remainder of your studies and look for ways to improve your profile in additional ways.

        s10: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance as a student. As a graduate, you can now market yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Are your high grades still important? Yes. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. If you are currently looking for an offer, then adding additional academic qualifications will probably not help that much - you will probably already make it past the entry barrier in most reviews, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades and academic qualifications. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant work experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships are probably the most relevant factor here.

        s11: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you really took to your field and markedly improved your measureable performance as a student. As a Phd student, you can now market yourself as an extremely motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Are your high grades still important? Yes. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. If you are currently looking for an offer in the business world, then adding additional academic qualifications will likely not help that much - you already make it past the entry barrier in most reviews, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades and academic qualifications. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant work experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships or recommendations from professors or your network are probably the most relevant factor here. Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for.

        s12: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you really invested into your academic education and can now market yourself as an extremely motivated and disciplined candidate to potential employers. Your grades from school are certainly not important anymore - you have moved on since then. But your academic grades are highly relevant. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role.

        s14: "Excellent: You completed both your undergraduate and graduate studies quickly and without delays. This is a positive sign to potential employers, demonstrating your focus to the task at hand. For a variety of reasons, not everyone can complete their studies that quickly. But as an employer, seeing that someone has paid attention to the schedule and delivered all required work within the suggested timeline is another plus. Quite often, you might have had to make sacrifices when it came to your personal life, hobbies and interests - and you made them to work on your study progress. You might want to bring this up during interviews, depending on the situation, to illustrate the approach you take when planning larger projects or parts of your career. Employers like to see long-term thinking and planning, and if you can connect your study speed with your long term career goals, then you may score another point during the interview."
        s15: "Very good: You completed both your undergraduate studies quickly and without delays, but it seems like you took a bit longer with your master. Short study times are a positive sign to potential employers, demonstrating your focus to the task at hand. However, for a variety of reasons, not everyone can complete their studies that quickly - and it's your job to come up with good and understandable reasons to explain delays. Remember that you don't need to justify them - you never need to justify anything to anyone - but that you might want to present your situation in an honest light. Even if your reason for the final delay was an extended holiday or lack of focus on the final thesis, you can still be honest with the person you are speaking with: This demonstrates credibility, and the recruiter will appreciate your honesty. Employers like to see long-term thinking and planning, and if you can connect your study speed with your long term career goals (e.g. to enjoy your study life first and then focus on work), then you may score another point during the interview."

        s17: "Suggestion: It took you a bit longer to finish your undergraduate studies. Depending on your situation, there might have been very good reasons for this - and a lack of focus or motivation at some point during your studies does not need to be a negative factor. In fact, being candid about the challenges you faced during your studies - and how you overcame them - makes you credible and honest during interviews, demonstrating your growth and value as a person. Taking your time might also be more than compensated for if you worked - or had to work - during your studies, and additional experience you gained with other organizations can be highly valuable for emplyers. Advice: Be open about the delays and reasons for them, and if you are still in the process of completing your degree, then try to compensate by adding valuable skills and experiences to your CV."
        s18: "Suggestion: You had average or low grades while you completed your secondary and tertiary education. This can be a negative sign for potential employers, and you are probably not too happy about it either. Still, you should be proud of yourself for walking a difficult path - and taking it to the end. Your studies should not only help you gain more knowledge about specific topics, but also help you in finding yourself as a person. Quite often, average or low grades stem from a lack of interest in a topic, and you might have found the academic side of things to be boring or less relevant for yourself. Having significant work experience can more than compensate for the academic results, and there are many, many roles with great companies that do not require the academic background material you covered. Try to get as much experience as you can before you graduate. Then sell yourself as a practical person, willing to learn and perform, and prove that you can deliver in practice, where it counts. The second you hit the job, nobody cares about your grades - only about your results. And if you deliver, you will have many career options open in front of you. "

Still, you should be proud of yourself for walking a difficult path - and taking it to the end. Your studies should not only help you gain more knowledge about specific topics, but also help you in finding yourself as a person. Quite often, average or low grades stem from a lack of interest in a topic, and you might have found the academic side of things to be boring or less relevant for yourself. Having significant work experience can more than compensate for the academic results, and there are many, many roles with great companies that do not require the academic background material you covered.

Most larger organizations today have distributed operations in multiple countries and often on multiple continents, and being able to speak the host country language is highly advantageous. Quite often, companies will only send staff abroad if the employee has already acquired semi-fluent language skills in that language before the trip. And don't feel limited in your choices - you might want to learn Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian or another often spoken language, as this seems to be the standard advice, but being able to speak one or more rarely spoken languages (for your culture) can be an incredible competitive advantage.

        s300: "Suggestion: You speak many languages and have indicated that English is not one of them. While you can certainly build yourself into a valuable professional and become successful and happy without speaking fluent English, you will find that command of the English language is extremely beneficial. First of all, many positions in business, engineering or management simply require fluent English - companies looking for candidates can very easily filter and exclude applicants who lack this language skill. This might strongly limit the number of opportunities available to you. And larger organizations today have distributed operations in multiple countries and often on multiple continents, and more and more companies are switching to English as a common language within the upper management levels. While having good English language skills will not make you stand out from the crowd, you will always notice a disadvantage when you are discussing selection procedures or international opportunities. On another note, having a good grasp of the English language can provide you with access to a wealth of learning materials, literature and educational opportunities - which you would not have otherwise. So even if management isn't really part of your career plans, you will find that being able to speak with other leading professionals in your field becomes much more easy if you speak English as well, allowing you to build a larger network and to grow faster as a professional. As you already bring a wealth of knowledge when it comes to various languages, you will also probably find it easy to improve your skills to a workable level, considerably increasing your flexibility and range of opportunities available."

If your past experiences with language learning have been negative - especially during your secondary education - then taking a professional level language couse, taking part in a summer academy or working one-on-one with a private teacher will be a great opportunity to discover your hidden ability to learn and speak languages quickly. Motivation and the level of teaching are often limiting factors, taking professional language courses amongst grown ups will put you in a different environment full of energy and motivation. Expect to invest at least 4-6 weeks into growing your basic understanding and another one or two years of regular language exposure to further improve your skills: You will benefit from the result for the rest of your life."

        s2: "Suggestion: You have not indicated any skills in your profile. Skills are valuable for companies looking for candidates, as they can search for specific expertise easily. If you add some of the skills you have acquired so far - even if you do not think too much of them - then there is a better chance for recruiters to look at your profile and to connect with you. Adding your skills will also allow you to compare yourself with other candidates and to see where you can easily improve yourself."
        s3: "Good.  You indicated some skills on your profile and recruiters can now find you via the candidate search more easily. This makes it easier for them to connect with you. However, it seems as if you only indicated a few skills and you certainly posses more than that. Think about the way you deal with others, about your skills when handling software and your experiences in organizing things. Maybe you find some other skills to add to your profile, strengthening it further. Recruiters like seeing skills on your profile, as this makes it easier to understand your abilities. Conversely, you might want to check out job postings that describe possible future roles in two, five and ten years, and to check the kind of skills that are required there. Can you find a way to acquire these skills during your studies and when you start working? Having a clear understanding of the required skills makes it much easier for you to develop yourself further and to fulfill your goals."
        s4: "Excellent. You indicated many skills on your profile and recruiters can now find you via the candidate search more easily. This makes it more likely for them to connect with you and increases your career opportunities. You also indicated a high hour count in some of them, positioning yourself as an expert in these skills. This lets your profile stand out from other candidates. However, companies in general want to see a demonstration of your skills and abilities - normally, they will ask you during your application process about these skills and how you came to acquire them, so be prepared for this. For your further professional growth, you might want to check out job postings that describe interesting future roles for you in two, five and ten years, and to check the kind of skills that are required there. Can you find a way to acquire these skills during your studies and when you start working? Having a clear understanding of the required skills makes it much easier for you to develop yourself further and to fulfill your goals, and researching these skills in advance will give you a large competitive advantage versus other candidates."
        s5: "Very good. You indicated many skills on your profile and recruiters can now find you via the candidate search more easily. This makes it more likely for them to connect with you and increases your career opportunities. You also indicated a relatively high hour count in most of them, positioning yourself as a specialist.  This lets your profile stand out from other candidates. However, companies in general want to see a demonstration of your skills and abilities - normally, they will ask you during your application process about these skills and how you came to acquire them, so be prepared for this. Do you want to improve yourself even further? Compare your current skills against the requirements of job postings that describe interesting future roles for you in two, five and ten years. Can you find a way to acquire these skills during your studies and when you start working? Having a clear understanding of the required skills makes it much easier for you to develop yourself further and to fulfill your goals, and researching these skills in advance will give you a large competitive advantage versus other candidates."

        s7: "Good. You indicated many skills on your profile and recruiters can now find you via the candidate search more easily. This makes it more likely for them to connect with you and increases your career opportunities. However, it seems as if you have relatively little experience with these skills.

        s8: "Suggestion: While you indicated many skills on your profile, you have no awards, no publications, no scholarships and no work experience on your CV. This makes it difficult for recruiters to understand how and where you acquired those skills. In practice, skills are used to deliver results, and being able to document them either via experience or through certifications certainly helps. Recruiters are generally highly skeptical when reviewing CVs and less is often more when selling yourself. If you want to improve your profile, then find ways to certifiy or document your skills, and be ready to explain how you acquired them - and how they will be useful for a company."
        s9: "Suggestion: You have some work experience already and know how to perform different roles. This work experience will likely have resulted in additional skills you can use in other situations as well. Currently, you are indicating only a few skills on your profile, and it is likely that you have much more to offer. Thinks about the experiences you have made and add some more skills."

        s110: "Dependendo do tipo de indústria e empresa, o seu perfil será um importante ativo. Aprender uma nova língua não só reforça as suas competências de comunicação, mas também lhe permite aprender mais acerca de diferentes culturas e analisar novas situações de modo diferenciado."
        s110a: "Conselho:"
        s111: "Deverá focar-se nas suas competências linguísticas e na flexibilidade que estas proporcionam às empresas. Destas, as que competem a nível global dão preferência a candidatos que falem várias línguas."

        s115: "Apoiou a sua comunidade e envolveu-se numa boa causa."
        s116: "Os seus esforços são reconhecidos. Apoiou organizações a mudar o mundo e ganhou com isso experiência em lidar com contratempos, colegas difíceis e outras dificuldades.Também revela experiência em motivar e convencer os outros - competências chave procuradas por qualquer empregador."
        s117: "Um vasto serviço comunitário transmite-lhe as competências e experiência relevantes para o dia-a-dia no trabalho. Quais as situações mais difíceis porque passou e como lidou com elas? O que é que faria melhor numa próxima oportunidade? Que competências desenvolveu?"
        s118: "Tem diversas publicações"
        s119: "O seu conhecimento profundo dos tópicos de interesse, as suas habilidades técnicas e de comunicação conduziram à elaboração de diversar publicações assinadas com o seu nome. Investiu tempo e esforço e já se tornou expert nestes temas - o que documenta publicamente a sua perseverança e motivação para entregar resultados com princípio, meio e fim."
        s12: Top
        s120: "As publicações são uma credencial que suporta a atitude em ambiente de trabalho. Parilhe connosco as suas publicações e conte-nos quais as competências que desenvolveu no processo de criação e publicação."
        s121: "Recebeu prémios e distinções."
        s122: "\"Passion leads to performance\". A sua performance foi reconhecida - quer tenha sido uma realização intelectual ou desportiva, demonstrou resultados excepcionais e o reconhecimento por esse facto."
        s123: "A paixão é importante, tal como os resultados. Quando fizer uma candidatura a uma oferta de emprego, mencione os seus esforços e motivações procurando ligar com as novas funções a assumir."
        s124: "Recebeu incentivos monetários.   "
        s125: "Incentivos monetários sinalizam uma seleção prévia. Alguém reconheceu em si determinadas qualidades e decidiu atribuir-lhe uma compensação monetária ou outro tipo de suporte. Os incentivos obtidos tornam mais fácil a futuros empregadores identificarem excelência - o que aconteceu no seu caso."
        s126: "Trabalhou arduamente para receber este incentivo, pelo que deverá ser capaz de explicar como este mesmo incentivo tornou o seu percurso um pouco mais fácil, pemitindo-lhe ao mesmo tempo melhorar ainda mais a sua performance."

        s128: "Pontos de melhoria"
        s129: "Falta de experiência profissional significativa."
        s13: "Análise da experiência profissional"
        s130: "Potenciais empregadores encaram a falta de experiência profissional como um fator de risco. Se no seu caso pessoal nunca tiver tido uma experiência prévia em determinada indústria, poderá não perceber ou respeitar a cultura de trabalho ou as tarefas desempenhadas nesse contexto. Existe também o risco de sentir alguma frustração com o seu desempenho diário, o que poderá levar a que procure outras oportunidades profissionais."
        s131: "Procure fazer alguns estágios em indústrias relevantes, testando assim a sua adaptação ao meio. Mesmo que não sinta muito interessee, poderá gradualmente formar uma opinião acerca da área em que realmente pretende trabalhar."
        s132: "O seu desempenho no Secundário situou-se abaixo da média"
        s133: "Lamentavelmente é algo que não pode ser alterado. No entanto, é uma situação que não terá necessáriamente um impacto negativo no seu desempenho profissional futuro - se sentir uma pessoa motivada para conseguir um bom desempenho, focar-se no trabalho que tem em mãos e preferir a prática mais do que a teoria, poder-se-á vender muito bem a potenciais empregadores. Claro que as coisas serão mais fáceis, se conseguir demonstrar ter efetuado estágios e certificados profissionais relevantes e adequados ao trabalho a desempenhar."
        s134: "Concentre-se em outras facetas mais relevantes do seu perfil e fale sobre aquilo que é realmente importante. A pessoa que o entrevistar sabe quão irrelevante pode ser o seu resultado académico para o papel a desempenhar. Ele estará mais interessado em ouvir as razões pelas quais o seu desempenho será excelente. Realce estes aspetos e ignore o passado."
        s135: "O seu desempenho na Universidade situou-se abaixo da média."
        s136: "Talvez ainda tenha a possibilidade de melhorar os seus resultados. Dependendo da indústria onde pretende trabalhar, os potenciais empregadores poderão concentrar-se nas suas notas, caso a teoria seja determinante para a vaga a ocupar. No entanto, se alterar o seu foco de preferência, ter notas menos fortes poderá não ser um problema - desde que consiga passar a mensagem de que foi a falta de interesse nos conteúdos do curso e não a sua falta de esforço, que foram responsáveis pelos seus resultados."
        s137: "As más notas não deverão limitar a sua performance no trabalho. Comunique este facto e partilhe com o seu entrevistador os seus planos de carreira e aspirações e como pretende alcançá-los. Nem todos têm que ter um duplo Doutoramento! De facto, alguns empregos beneficiarão de uma pessoa capaz de desenvolver um abordagem mais prática."
