        s100: "Analysis and Suggestions"
        s101: "Applying for jobs and internships is the ultimate test of your paper-based credentials. Take a look below to find suggestions and hints regarding your CV and what you can do to perform better."
        s102: "Analysis of positive elements"        
        s103: "Your grades are excellent."
        s104: "You are a hard-working, concentrated and motivated student. Your grades demonstrate deep knowledge of the theory and your results validate yourself as a valuable colleague."
        s105: "Describe your motivation and the way you work to get the grades you want. What motivated you to perform so well? Share your motivation in application letters and during interviews."
        s106: "You finished school with excellent grades."
        s107: "Your school results show a disciplined approach to exams and work."
        s108: "Explain how you prepare yourself and how you approach new challenges (do not focus on the results too much). Companies are looking for diligent, serious and motivated colleagues. Your grades show that you are one of them."
        s109: "Superior language skills."        
        s110: "Depending on the kind of industry and company, you will be a very valuable asset to any company. Learning a language does not only provide you with communication skills, but has also allowed you to learn more about different cultures and to analyse situations differently."
        s110a: "Advice:"
        s111: "Focus on your languages skills and the flexibility this provides for the company. Globally competitive companies prefer multilingual candidates."
        s112: "Many interests and skills"
        s113: "You have earned experience in many different situations and are used to dealing with new environments and topics. A broad set of knowledge and skills is valuable as it show that you are open to learning and mastering new abilities."
        s114: "Describe your motivation to acquire these skills. Why did you enjoy learning this? Passion is exciting, companies and colleagues would love to see you bring the same passion to your work."
        s115: "You have provided service to your community and engaged yourself in a good cause."
        s116: "Your efforts are recognized. You supported organizations in changing the world and have earned experience in dealing with setbacks and difficult colleagues and situations. You also have experience in motivating and convincing people - valuable skills for any employee."
        s117: "Extensive community service provides you with skills and experiences relevant to the daily work life. Present these experiences and your learning results. Which situations were difficult, how did you handle them? What would you do better next time? Which skills did you develop? "
        s118: "You have multiple publications"
        s119: "Your deep knowledge of topics of interest and polished technical or communication skills have led to multiple publications with your name on them. You invested time and effort into these topics and have become an expert already - this documents your perseverance and motivation to provide complete results."
        s120: "Publications are a credential to support your professional work attitude. Provide links to your publications and communicate the skills you improved during the creation and publication process."
        s121: "You received awards or prizes."
        s122: "Passion leads to performance. And your performance was recognized - whether this was an intellectual or sportive achievement, you have shown exceptional results and were lauded for this."
        s123: "Passion is important. So are results. When writing applications, mention your efforts and your motivations and draw a link to your new tasks."
        s124: "You received scholarships"
        s125: "Scholarships signal previous selection. Other parties have recognized a certain quality and decided to reward you financially or with support. Scholarships make it easier for future employers to find excellence - and you have earned your scholarship."
        s126: "You have worked hard to receive this scholarship and should be able to explain how this scholarship has eased your path a bit, while allowing you to focus on even better performance."
        s127: "You are doing great. Keep it up!"
        s128: Improvements
        s129: "Lack of significant work experience."
        s130: "Employers will treat lack of significant work experience as a risk factor. If you have never worked in an industry before, you might not understand or respect the work culture, the tasks performed by colleagues or your future job. There is a small risk that you will be disappointed by your daily work and will look to find other opportunities."
        s131: "Complete a few internships in relevant industries and test the waters. Even if you are not strongly interested, you can create an exclusion list and gradually form an opinion about the kind of industry you really want to work in."
        s132: "School grades were below average"
        s133: "Can't be changed. But this does not have to impact your future performance at work - if you are highly motivated to perform well, focus on the task at hand and prefer daily work life over theory, then you might sell yourself well to potential employers. This of course becomes more easy if you can also provide relevant internships and good certificates for the work you did."
        s134: "Focus on other, more important things and speak about the things that matter. Your interview partner knows how irrelevant your school grades can be for the position you are going to fill and is more interested in hearing reasons why you will perform well. Deliver these, ignore the past."
        s135: "Study grades are below average."
        s136: "You might still be able to improve these grades. Depending on the industry, employers will focus on your grades if the theory will be relevant for your future position. However, if you change industries, then having weaker grades should not be a problem - as long as you can communicate that they might be due to other priorities or lack in knowledge or ability in this field, and not a lack of effort."
        s137: "Bad grades should not limit you in becoming excellent in your work. Communicate this and tell your interview partner about your career plans and aspirations and how you want to achive them. Not everybody needs to be a double-degree PhD - certain jobs will actually benefit from a more practical hands-on person."        
      analysis_awards:
        s1: "Awards"
        s2: "You have not indicated any awards you might have earned so far. Awards are useful as they provide additional social proof about your abilities and motivation. You can earn them through sportive achievements or through competing in other fields that interest you, and quite often the experience itself is highly valuable on its own. Checkout the different competitions offered at your university: If you are a law, mathematics, physics, chemistry, business or engineering student, then you will find ample opportunities to enter competitions - and if your university doesn't offer or take part in any events in your field, then it might be a great time investment to join a national competition or set-up your own (this will also be highly valuable for your personal network)."
        s3: "Congratulations, you have received an award for your hard work. This award can be used to provide additional proof of your abilities and motivations for employers looking for talent. At the very least, the award shows that you are active in your field and, depending on the exact area, might also provide a positive insight into your hobbies and personality. Employers might bring the award up in job interviews to get you into story-telling mode. This is your opportunity to explain your thinking process, and the hard work you put into gaining the award. "
        s4: "Congratulations, you have received a prize after successfully competing in your field. This award can be used to provide additional proof of your abilities and motivations for employers looking for talent. At the very least, the award shows that you are active in your field and, depending on the exact area, might also provide a positive insight into your hobbies and personality. Employers might bring the prize up in job interviews to get you into story-telling mode. This is your opportunity to explain your thinking process, and the hard work you put into winning it."
        s5: "Excellent. You earned multiple awards through your hard work - and your time investment and determination will be recognized by potential employers. Having your awards visible is especially interesting if they are related to the field you are entering - and it's up to you to provide the linkage. You might want to mention your learning experiences and general mindsets that have lead to your success both in application letters and during the interview, as this provides a great opportunity to explain your thinking and attitude towards challenges to the recruiters. If you have a multitude of awards, it might be best to only provide the most outstanding results to avoid overloading the recruiter mentally - it takes time to process too much information, and especially when you are building your one- or two-page CV, ensure that you keep it easy to understand and validate."
        s6: "Very good. You earned multiple awards through your hard work - and your time investment and determination will be recognized by potential employers. Having your awards visible is especially interesting if they are related to the field you are entering - and it's up to you to provide the linkage. You might want to mention your learning experiences and general mindsets that have lead to your success both in application letters and during the interview, as this provides a great opportunity to explain your thinking and attitude towards challenges to the recruiter."
      analysis_education:
        s1: "Education"
        s2: "Excellent - you finished your secondary education with high grades and are also doing well in your undergraduate studies."
        s2a: "Apart from the knowledge you have acquired, you will find that the results you have earned through hard work and discipline will be valuable for your career, as recruiters often use grades as one of the defining elements in reviewing candidates. Think about it like this: When you receive thirty applications, then it is mentally and practically very easy to sort them by average grades. At the same time, it is much more difficult to properly assess the value of various skills and interests and to compare candidates on those factors."
        s2b: "Are there more ways to benefit from high grades? Certainly. You might want to look for (additional) merit based scholarships or for the possibility to receive an award within your field. Your grades should also make it easier for you to open doors into companies, and, together with your knowledge, you might even already be able to cooperate with academics in your field on some publications. Success begets success, if you use it correctly. Concerning applications for internships and graduate jobs, you should make it easy for recruiters to understand not only the results you have earned, but also the formative experience you gained."
        s2c: "Use your results to demonstrate how you think about new challenges and upcoming tasks, how you prepare yourself and how you deal with setbacks and new opportunities. You have worked hard and can provide proof of this with your results, so make sure you mention it in your application letters and during interviews. Some of your key selling points should be consistency and discipline, which are very important for companies, and your track record demonstrates that these attributes apply to you."
        s3: "Excellent - you finished your secondary education with high grades and have also been doing well in your studies. "

Success begets success, if you use it correctly. Concerning applications for internships and graduate jobs, you should make it easy for recruiters to understand not only the results you have earned, but also the formative experience you gained. Use your results to demonstrate how you think about new challenges and upcoming tasks, how you prepare yourself and how you deal with setbacks and new opportunities. Especially during your Phd, you have had ample opportunities to grow professionally. How have you overcome the challenges presented to you? What did you learn?"
        s5c: "Use example stories to illustrate the most relevant situations and then link this to the job you want to do. Another thing recruiters want to see is proof of hard work - and your track record certainly is strong here. Make sure you mention it in your application letters and during interviews. Also, some of your key selling points should be consistency and discipline, which are very important for companies, and your degrees and grades demonstrates that these attributes apply to you."
        s6: "Excellent. You decided to invest additional time and capital into further business education and earned high grades during all of your academic experiences."
        s6a: "As an experienced candidate you certainly already know a lot about the way interviews are conducated and about how to present yourself in the best possible light during the interview process. As you are already playing at the highest levels, your salary expectations and application material should match: Due to the number of experiences and results you had, it might be difficult to create a one- or two- page CV that makes all of your qualities visible in the best way."
        s6b: "A suggestion here: Invest a small amount of capital to have your CV reviewed by two or three external agencies (after it went through the career services department), and practice your interviews three or four times with experts before you are going in. This will provide you with the optimal preparation and helps you outcompete others with similar qualifications."
        s7: "Excellent. You earned high grades during your studies and even during your secondary education. "
        s7a: "As an experienced candidate you know that your professional track record is key to your success, but at certain points gate-keepers will still look back at what you did academically. As of now, you might have eliminated further education from your thoughts and want to focus on your career, which is certainly viable."
        s7b: "However, investing a small amount of time in a summer course or executive education can still pay off - not only in terms of the education as such, but more as an opportunity to meet other people with a similar background."
        s7c: "Regarding the overall application process, you certainly already know which factors are the most relevant on your CV. Keep the education section short and focus more on your current and relevant achievements - you might have a long list to choose from."
        s8: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance during your studies. "
        s8a: "This makes it easy to show yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Even with all your other beneficial qualities, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role."
        s8b: "The advice here is simple: Keep your grades up during your studies and look for ways to improve your profile in additional ways. You will probably already make it past the entry barrier, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships are probably the most relevant factor here."
        s8c: "Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for. During the interview itself, you can use the improvement in grades as an example to show how well you can perform and how you have trained yourself to always become better."
        s9: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance during your extensive studies."
        s9a: "Ideally, you try to create a clear trend line of always improving grades from your undergraduate to your master studies. This makes it easy to show yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Why is this important? Even with all your other beneficial qualities, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. "
        s9b: "The advice here is simple: Keep your grades up during the remainder of your studies and look for ways to improve your profile in additional ways. You will probably already make it past the entry barrier, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships are probably the most relevant factor here."

        s10: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you have markedly improved your measureable performance as a student. "
        s10a: "As a graduate, you can now market yourself as a motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Are your high grades still important? Yes. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. "
        s10b: "If you are currently looking for an offer, then adding additional academic qualifications will probably not help that much - you will probably already make it past the entry barrier in most reviews, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades and academic qualifications. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant work experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships are probably the most relevant factor here."
        s10c: "Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for. During the interview itself, you can use the improvement in grades as an example to show how well you can perform and how you have trained yourself to always become better."
        s11: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you really took to your field and markedly improved your measureable performance as a student. "
        s11a: "As a Phd student, you can now market yourself as an extremely motivated and disciplined candidate to potential recruiters. Are your high grades still important? Yes. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role."
        s11b: "If you are currently looking for an offer in the business world, then adding additional academic qualifications will likely not help that much - you already make it past the entry barrier in most reviews, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades and academic qualifications. Your best strategy then is to provide proof of relevant work experience or skills that make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position - internships or recommendations from professors or your network are probably the most relevant factor here."
        s11c: " Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for. During the interview itself, you can use the improvement in grades as an example to show how well you can perform and how you have trained yourself to always become better - a trend you intend to continue."
        s12: "Very good. While your grades during your secondary education were not outstanding, you really invested into your academic education and can now market yourself as an extremely motivated and disciplined candidate to potential employers. "
        s12a: "Your grades from school are certainly not important anymore - you have moved on since then. But your academic grades are highly relevant. Even with all your other beneficial qualities and experiences, recruiters often tend to look at the grades you earned first, as this seems to make it easy to compare you with other candidates. Your positive result makes it easy for them to remember you as a great candidate academically, which normally is enough to move you into closer consideration for a role. If you are currently looking for an offer in the business world, then adding additional academic qualifications will likely not help that much - you already make it past the entry barrier in most reviews, so during the next comparison round you will be competing with other candidates that have similar grades and academic qualifications. Your best strategy then is to tailor your extensive experience on your resume to make it easy for a recruiter to imagine putting you into a certain position. Your experience and additionally, recommendations from professors or your network are probably the most relevant factor for further success. Mention your good grades during the application process, for example in the application letter, to demonstrate your motivation and ability to work hard, and draw a link to the tasks that need to be performed in the role you are applying for."

        s14: "Excellent: You completed both your undergraduate and graduate studies quickly and without delays. "
        s14a: "This is a positive sign to potential employers, demonstrating your focus to the task at hand. For a variety of reasons, not everyone can complete their studies that quickly. But as an employer, seeing that someone has paid attention to the schedule and delivered all required work within the suggested timeline is another plus. "
        s14b: "Quite often, you might have had to make sacrifices when it came to your personal life, hobbies and interests - and you made them to work on your study progress. You might want to bring this up during interviews, depending on the situation, to illustrate the approach you take when planning larger projects or parts of your career."
        s14c: "Employers like to see long-term thinking and planning, and if you can connect your study speed with your long term career goals, then you may score another point during the interview."
        s15: "Very good: You completed your undergraduate studies quickly and without delays, but it seems like you took a bit longer with your master. "
        s15a: "Short study times are a positive sign to potential employers, demonstrating your focus to the task at hand. However, for a variety of reasons, not everyone can complete their studies that quickly - and it's your job to come up with good and understandable reasons to explain delays."
        s15b: "Remember that you don't need to justify them - you never need to justify anything to anyone - but that you might want to present your situation in an honest light. Even if your reason for the final delay was an extended holiday or lack of focus on the final thesis, you can still be honest with the person you are speaking with: This demonstrates credibility, and the recruiter will appreciate your honesty. Employers like to see long-term thinking and planning, and if you can connect your study speed with your long term career goals (e.g. to enjoy your study life first and then focus on work), then you may score another point during the interview."
        s16: "Excellent: You completed your undergraduate studies quickly and without delays. This is a positive sign to potential employers, demonstrating your focus to the task at hand. "
        s16a: "For a variety of reasons, not everyone can complete their studies that quickly. But as an employer, seeing that someone has paid attention to the schedule and delivered all required work within the suggested timeline is another plus."

        s16c: "Employers like to see long-term thinking and planning, and if you can connect your study speed with your long term career goals, then you may score another point during the interview."
        s17: "It took you a bit longer to finish your undergraduate studies. Depending on your situation, there might have been very good reasons for this - and a lack of focus or motivation at some point during your studies does not need to be a negative factor. "
        s17a: "In fact, being candid about the challenges you faced during your studies - and how you overcame them - makes you credible and honest during interviews, demonstrating your growth and value as a person. Taking your time might also be more than compensated for if you worked - or had to work - during your studies, and additional experience you gained with other organizations can be highly valuable for emplyers."
        s17b: "Advice: Be open about the delays and reasons for them, and if you are still in the process of completing your degree, then try to compensate by adding valuable skills and experiences to your CV."
        s18: "You had average or low grades while you completed your secondary and tertiary education. This can be a negative sign for potential employers, and you are probably not too happy about it either. "
        s18a: "Still, you should be proud of yourself for walking a difficult path - and taking it to the end. Your studies should not only help you gain more knowledge about specific topics, but also help you in finding yourself as a person."
        s18b: "Quite often, average or low grades stem from a lack of interest in a topic, and you might have found the academic side of things to be boring or less relevant for yourself. Having significant work experience can more than compensate for the academic results, and there are many, many roles with great companies that do not require the academic background material you covered."
        s18c: "Try to get as much experience as you can before you graduate. Then sell yourself as a practical person, willing to learn and perform, and prove that you can deliver in practice, where it counts.

        s1: "Languages"
        s2: "Suggestion: You have not yet indicated a language on your CV. Languages includes your native language, so having a profile with zero language entries is kind of weird. And if you can read this, then certainly English should be listed."
        s3: "Suggestion: You are currently finishing your undergraduate studies and have only indicated one language under your language skills. "
        s3a: "Most people acquire at least an basic understanding of other languages during their secondary education or via their hobbies, so don't be afraid to list basic language skills in other languages. Many employers correctly do not put too much value on additional language skills - if your future role is limited to one geographic and cultural area, there is no need to learn more - but your further career chances might be severely hampered by being unable to communicate in another, common, language."
        s3b: "Many larger organizations today have distributed operations in multiple countries and often on multiple continents, and being able to speak the host country language is highly advantageous. Quite often, companies will only send staff abroad if the employee has already acquired semi-fluent language skills in that language before the trip."
        s3c: "And don't feel limited in your choices - you might want to learn Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Russian or another often spoken language, as this seems to be the standard advice, but being able to speak one or more rarely spoken languages (for your culture) can be an incredible competitive advantage. If you are flexible in terms of the opportunities you pursue, then being able to speak English, Polish and Thai, for example, might make you uniquely valuable for a few organizations. And it's easier than ever to be found, today."
        s3d: "As you are still within your undergraduate studies, you can easily invest additional time in a part-time or summer course, where you acquire basic or advanced language skills within a few weeks.

Companies generally require fluency in the native language and another common one, like English, from applicants for management or young professional positions."
        s4b: "It is also much more advantageous to speak a single language fluently than to speak multiple languagues at a basic or advanced level, as business meetings with multiple external participants generally operate at a speed that requires true fluency. Companies will also rarely send someone abroad if that person only has limited language skills and will generally not invest into language courses. "
        s4c: "While you can invest time into additional languages, keep in mind whether you want to build them to a truly fluent level or whether you just treat them as a hobby. If you find that your time is better invested in acquiring additional professional experiences or skills, then focus on these activities instead."
        s4d: "Languages act as multiplier for your professional expertise. If you are an experienced professional and are able to generate demand from 100 clients in your culture, then having additional language skills might make it possible to demonstrate your skills in front of 100 clients from a second culture. However, someone with limited professional expertise might not be able to draw 10 clients from his culture, and will also only have limited success abroad - the demand simply isn't there yet."

        s15d: "In general, even the most motivated candidates still have much to learn before they can actually contribute independently to the growth of a company, and the first months on the job are often just spent trying to understand and master the basic demands of the position. "
        s15e: "Getting significant experience is one of the most important things you can do - not only because you might qualify yourself further for a specific role, but even more so because it helps you to understand the requirements and daily work flow in the industries you work in. "
        s15f: "Many students do not know yet which path they want to follow during the next few years, and putting some months into earning more experience will help you understand better whether the career path you envision is actually interesting or not. "
        s15g: "One of the best ways to learn about an industry is to do an (unpaid) internship for a few weeks or months. This allows you to gain an insight into the company, the industry and the work place, all at the same time. Whether the internship itself is interesting, paid or successful doesn't matter that much - it is much more important that you keep your eyes and ears open and try to understand what the other people are doing and whether you could imagine working in this role, company or industry at all. "
        s15h: "You can also use the internship to build yourself a network and to connect with colleagues and decision makers. If you do a good job, they will help you out further along the way, and many larger companies use internships to evaluate potential new colleagues. Take these opportunities and work hard - Good luck!"
        s16: "Suggestion: You have limited work experience. Unless you are purely focused on the academic realm or are studying something far removed from the normal business world, you need to be really convincing with your other experiences to be competitive. "

        s17: "Excellent: You have significant work experience in different roles, where you stayed for an extended period. "
        s17a: "This fulfills the critera recruiters will use to assess your profile. As you know, your academic background is rarely the most important thing in the work place. Having practical experience, connections and skills makes a much larger difference. "

        s17e: "However, your biggest challenge right now might be inherent to the current economic conditons surrounding your specialisation and situation. Try to find a professional, full-time role, even if it is within another field or outside of your comfort zone to build yourself further. The experience you acquire there can be used to get you into a better position in another field later, and you can use all your time there to build your network in different fields. "

        s18b: "If you profile is more broad, and you haven't found your specialisation yet, you might want to identify the area interests you the most and that is currently in demand by companies. "
