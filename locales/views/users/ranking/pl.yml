        s100: "Analizy i Sugestie"
        s101: "Poszukiwanie pracy lub stażu rozpoczyna się od aplikacji w formie CV i /lub listu motywacyjnego. Poniżej możesz znaleźć sugestie i wskazówki w jaki sposób ulepszyć swoje CV."
        s102: "Analiza pozytywnych elementów"
        s103: "Twoje stopnie są doskonałe."
        s104: "Jesteś pracowitym, skoncentrowanym i zmotywowanym studentem. Twoje stopnie wskazują na głęboką wiedzę teorytyczną jaką posiadzasz, a uzysakane przez Ciebie wyniki sprawjają, że jesteś wartościowym współpracownikiem. ."

        s109: "Świetne umiejętności językowe."
        s110: "W zależności od branży i firmy, którą jesteś zainteresowany z pewnością będziesz bardzo cennym pracownikiem. Nauka języka obcego pozwala Ci nie tylko na umiejętną komunikację, ale również ułatwia Ci pogłębinie wiedzy na temat innych kultur oraz rozwija Twoje umiejętności rozwiązywania problemów."
        s110a: "Porady: "
        s111: "Skupiając się na swoich umiejętnościach językowych zapewniasz większą elastyczność swojemu przyszłemu pracodawcy. Globalnie firmy preferują wielojęzycznych kandydatów."
        s112: "Dużo zainteresowań i umiejętności"
        s113: "Zdobyłeś doświadczenie w wielu odmiennych sytuacjach obejmujących różne środowiska i tematy. Szeroki zestaw wiedzy i umiejętności jest bardzo cenny, ponieważ pokazuje, że jesteś otwarty na naukę i szybkie opanowywanie nowych umiejętności. "
        s114: "Opisz swoją motywację która pomogła Ci w zdobyciu tych umiejętności. Co skłoniło Ci się zdobywanie nowych doświadczeń? Pasja ekscytuje, a wszystkie firmy i przyszli współpracownicy chcieliby abyś z taką samą pasję podszedł do swojej  nowej pracy."
        s115: "Działałeś aktywnie w swoim środowisku oraz angażowałeś się w słuszne sprawy."
        s116: "Twoje wysiłki są doceniane. Organizacja którą wspierasz przyczynia się do globalnych zmian, a doświadczenie które zdobyłeś pomaga w radzeniu sobie z niepowodzeniami i trudnymi sytuacjami w życiu.

        s118: "Posiadzasz liczne publikacje"
        s119: "Twoja szeroka znajomość interesujących Cię tematów oraz pogłębiane umiejętności techniczne oraz komunikacyjne pozwoliły Ci na uzyskanie licznych publikacji.

        s123: "Pasja jest ważna. I równie ważne są wyniki. W trakcie aplikacji o pracę, opisz swoje wysiłki i swoje motywacje oraz napisz jak mogę Ci  one pomóc w realizacji nowych zadań. "
        s124: "Jesteś stypendystą"
        s125: "Stypendia sygnalizują Twoje wybory. Zostałeś uznany za swoją wysoką jakość i dzięki temu otrzymałeś wpracie np. finansowe. Stypendyści ułatwiają przyszłym pracodawcom znalezienie doskonałości - a ty zarobiłeś na swoje stypendium."
        s126: "Pracowałeś ciężko aby otrzymać to stypendium. W jaki sposób uławiło Ci ono dalszy rozwój pozwalając skupić się na jeszcze lepszych wynikach?"
        s127: "Radzisz sobie świetnia. Oby tak dalej!"
        s128: "Co można poprawić:"
        s129: "Brak znaczącego doświadczenia zawodowego."
        s130: "Pracodawcy traktują brak doświadczenia zawodowego jako czynnik ryzyka. Jeśli nigdy wcześniej nie pracowałeś w jakiejś branży, możesz nie zrozumieć i nie respektować kultury pracy, zadań wykonywanych przez współpracowników lub swoich przyszłych zobowiązań. Istnieje niewielkie ryzyko, że będziesz rozczarowany codzienną pracą i zdeycujesz się szukać innych możliwości rozwoju."
        s131: "Wykonaj kilka staży w odpowiednich branżach aby je lepiej poznać. Nawet jeśli nie są one bardzo interesujące, możesz dzięki temu utworzyć listę wykluczeń i stopniowo wyrobić sobie opinię na temat rodzaju przemysłu w którym naprawdę chcesz pracować.."
        s132: "Wyniki naukowe poniżej średniej."
        s133: "Nie możesz tego zmienić. Ale nie musi to wpływać na twoje wyniki w przyszłej pracy - jeśli jesteś zmotywowany aby dobrze wykonać swoją pracę, skupić się na swoich zadaniach oraz przekładasz praktykę nad teorię to możesz skutecznie sprzedać się potencjalnym pracodawcom. To oczywiście staje się prostsze, jeśli możesz zapewnić sobie odpowiednie praktyki oraz poświadczenie tego co na nich osiągnąłeś."
        s134: "Skup się na innych, ważniejszych kwestiach, mów o tym co istotne. Osoba przeprowadzająca z Tobą rozmowę wie jakie znaczenie mają Twoje wyniki naukowe, przy aplikacji na daną pozycję. Interesują ją powody dla których będziesz dobrze wykonywać swoją pracę. Dostarczając ich, uda Ci się zignorować przeszłości."
        s135: "Wyniki naukowe poniżej średniej."
        s136: "Nadal możesz poprawić te wyniki. Pracodawcy będą brać pod uwagę Twoje oceny w wypadku gdy wiedza teoretyczna istotnie wpływa na jakość pracy na tej pozycji. Jeśli jednak zdecydujesz się zmienić branże, słabe ocen nie powinny stanowić problemu. Postaraj się zakomunikować swojemu potencjalnemu pracodawcy, że to brak zainteresowania, a nie brak wysiłku, był odpowiedzialny za twoje wyniki."
        s137: "Złe stopnie nie powinny uniemożliwiać Ci bycia doskonałym w swojej pracy. Poinformuj osobę, która przeprowadza z Tobą wywiad o swoich planach zawodowych, aspiracjach oraz o tym jak chcesz je osiągnąć. Nie każdy musi posiadać tytuł profesora – niektóre stanowiska  skorzystają z bardziej praktycznego podejścia niż szerszej wiedzy teoretycznej."

        S4: "Gratulacje, otrzymałeś nagrodę dzięki udanemu konkurowaniu w swojej dziedzinie. Nagroda ta może być wykorzystana w celu zapewnienia pracodawcom dodatkowych dowodów Twoich umiejętności oraz Twojej motywacji do działania. Udowadnia ona, że jesteś aktywny w swojej dziedzinie lub w zależności od dokładnego obszaru z którego zostałeś nagrodzony, może stanowić pozytywny wgląd w Twoje zainteresowania i osobowość. Pracodawca może nawiązać do zdobytej nagrody w czasie rozmowy kwalifikacyjnej, aby wprowadzić Cię w proces opowiadania. To będzie Twoja szansa, aby wyjaśnić swój proces myślenia, oraz opisać ciężką pracę, dzięki której udało Ci się zdobyć opisywaną nagrodę."
        S5: "Bardzo dobrze, zdobyłeś wiele nagród dzięki swojej ciężkiej pracy – a inwestycja twojego czasu i determinacja w ich zdobyciu z pewnością będzie doceniona przez potencjalnych pracodawców. Twoje nagrody są szczególnie interesujące, jeśli dotyczą one dziedziny w której chcesz się rozwijać - a to od Ciebie zależy zapewnienie takiego powiązania. Być może warto będzie wspomnieć o swoich doświadczeniach edukacyjnych i ogólnym sposobie myślenia, które doprowadziło do Twojego sukcesu, zarówno w liście motywacyjnym jak i w trakcie rozmowy o pracę. Opis drogi do zdobycie nagrody jest również doskonałą okazją, aby przedstawić swoją postawę wobec wyzwań. "
        s1: Nagrody
        s2: "Nie dodałeś żadnych nagród do swojego CV. Dodanie nagród  jest ważne, ponieważ pozwala pracodawcom ocenić poziom twojej motywacji oraz potwierdza Twoje umiejętności. Nagrody możesz zdobyć poprzez osiągnięcia sportowe lub poprzez rywalizację w innych dziedzinach, które Cię interesują, często samo doświadczenie zdobyte w czasie rywalizacji jest bardzo cenne. Sprawdź jakie konkursy oferuje Twoja uczelnia. Jeśli jesteś studentem prawa, matematyki, fizyki, chemii, biznesu lub inżynierii, to z pewnością znajdziesz wiele okazji, aby wziąć udział w konkursach. Jeśli jednak Twój uniwersytet nie oferuje wydarzeń z Twojej dziedziny, to może świetną inwestycją będzie dołączenie do konkursu na poziomie krajowym lub stworzenie własnego konkursu (co może okazać się pomocne w budowie Twojej sieci kontaków). "
        s3: "Gratulacje, otrzymałeś nagrodę za swoją ciężką pracę. Nagroda ta może być wykorzystane w celu zapewnienia pracodawcom dodatkowych dowodów Twoich umiejętności oraz Twojej motywacji do działania.

Opis drogi do zdobycie nagrody jest również doskonałą okazją, aby przedstawić swoją postawę wobec wyzwań. Jeśli zdobyłeś wiele nagród, najlepszym wyjściem może być  przedstawienie tylko tych najważniejszych, aby uniknąć przeciążenia rekruterów nadmiarem informacji - gdy budujesz swoje jedno-lub dwustronicowy CV, upewnij się,  aby było ono łatwe do zrozumienia i zaaprobowania.

        s1: Edukacja
        s10: "Bardzo dobrze. Mimo, że Twoje oceny w szkole średniej nie były wybitne, udało Ci się znacznie poprawić swoje wyniki podczas studiów."
        s10a: "Jako absolwent, będziesz teraz oceniany jako zmotywowany i zdyscyplinowany kandydata do pracy? Czy twoje dobre wyniki w nauce nadal są ważne? Tak. Nawet biorąc pod uwagę wszystkie informację zawarte w CV, rekruterzy często mają tendencję do patrzenia na Twoje wyniki w nauce w pierwszej kolejności, ponieważ w ten sposób najprościej jest im porównać Ciebie z innymi kandydatami. Twoje dobre wyniki sprawiają, że łatwiej będzie im zapamiętać Ciebie jako dobrego kandydata pod względem wiedzy teoretycznej, co zazwyczaj wystarcza, abyś przesuną Cię wyżej na potencjalnej liście kandydatów. "
        s10b: "Jeśli obecnie szukasz pracy, dodatkowe kwalifikacje naukowe, nie koniecznie są czymś czego teraz szczególnie Ci potrzeba. Pokonując pierwsze etapy aplikacji o pracę, z pewnością będziesz konkurował z innymi kandydatami, którzy mają podobnie dobre wyniki w nauce. W tym wypadki najlepszą strategią wyróżnienia się spośród innych jest zebranie doświadczeń i umiejętności, które sprawiają, że rekruterom łatwo będzie wyobrazić sobie Ciebie w pracy o którą aplikujesz -  staże i praktyki są w tym przypadku prawdopodobniej najbardziej istotnym czynnikiem. "
        s10c: "Wspomnij o swoich dobrych wynikach w nauce w procesie aplikacji, na przykład w liście motywacyjnym. Wykaż takie cech jak zaangażowanie i zdolność do ciężkiej pracy, jednocześnie przedstaw to w takim świetle, aby cechy te były użyteczne w pracy o którą się ubiegasz. Podczas rozmowy o pracę, możesz użyć swoich coraz lepszych wyników w nauce jako przykładu, który pokazuje, że dzięki ciężkiej pracy stajesz się coraz lepszy. "
        s11: "Bardzo dobrze. Mimo, że Twoje wyniki w nauce w szkole średniej nie były znakomite, skonwertowanie się na wybranej przez Ciebie dziedzinie na studiach sprawiło, że znacznie poprawiłeś swoją wydajność."

W tym wypadki najlepszą strategią wyróżnienia się spośród innych jest zebranie doświadczeń i umiejętności, które sprawiają, że rekruterom łatwo będzie wyobrazić sobie Ciebie w pracy o którą aplikujesz -  staże, praktyki i rekomendację od Twoich przełożonych z uczelni są w tym przypadku prawdopodobniej najbardziej istotnym czynnikiem.

Twoje dobre wyniki sprawiają, że łatwiej będzie im zapamiętać Ciebie jako dobrego kandydata pod względem wiedzy teoretycznej, co zazwyczaj może przesunąć Cię wyżej na potencjalnej liście kandydatów. Jeśli poszukujesz pracy w środowisku profesjonalistów, dodatkowe kwalifikacje akademickie prawdopodobnie nie pomogą zbyt wiele. Z pewnością będziesz rywalizował o pracę z kandydatami, którzy mają podobne kwalifikacje akademickie i zawodowe. Najlepszą strategią w tym wypadku jest więc dostosowanie Twojego bogatego CV do pozycji o którą aplikujesz, tak aby rekruter z łatwością mógł sobie wyobrazić właśnie Ciebie na tej pozycji. Twoje doświadczenie, oraz dodatkowo, rekomendacje od profesorów lub ludzi z branży są prawdopodobnie najbardziej istotnymi czynnikami decydującym o Twoim sukcesie. Wspomnij o swoich dobrych wynikach w nauce w procesie aplikacji, na przykład w liście motywacyjnym. Wskaż na takie cech jak zaangażowanie i zdolność do ciężkiej pracy, jednocześnie przedstaw je w takim świetle, aby okazały się użyteczne w pracy o którą się ubiegasz. "

Twoja kariera jest już na znacznym poziomie rozwoju, co w oczywisty sposób rzutuje na wyższe oczekiwania płacowe w poszukiwaniu nowej  pracy. Pamiętaj, że Twoja aplikacja powinna odzwierciedlać Twoją wartość: Ze względu na liczne doświadczenia i osiągnięcia postaraj się stworzyć jedno-lub dwustronicowe CV, które podkreśla Twoje najlepsze cechy ."
        s12c: "Sugestia: Zainwestuj niewielką część swoich dochodów w profesjonalistów, którzy ocenią i poprawią Twoje CV jeśli zajdzie taka potrzeba. Przećwicz również symulację przebiegu rozmowy o pracę z ekspertami, zanim udasz się na prawdziwą rozmowę . To zapewni Ci optymalne przygotowanie i zapewni powodzenie przy konkurowaniu z innymi kandydatami o podobnych kwalifikacjach. "
        s13: "Bardzo dobrze, osiągnąłeś bardzo dobre wyniki w nauce w czasie studiów. Jako już doświadczony kandydat wiesz, że profesjonalizm i rozwój zawodowy jest kluczem do sukcesu, ale w niektórych wypadkach Twój pracodawca nadal może zechcieć spojrzeć wstecz na Twoje wyniki z czasów akademickich.

        s13a: " Teraz, możesz już w pewnym stopni zapomnieć o dalszej edukacji i skupić się na rozwoju swojej kariery, co z pewnością okaże się być opłacalnym wyborem. Jednak pamiętaj, że inwestycja czasu w kurs letni lub studia menadżerskie może okazać się opłacalną decyzją - nie tylko poprzez poszerzenie Twoje wiedzy, ale szczególnie ze względu na możliwość spotkania ludzi z Twojej branży."

        s14a: "Jest to bardzo pozytywny znak dla Twoich potencjalnych pracodawców, świadczący o tym, że bez problemu możesz skupić się na powierzonych Ci zadaniach. Z różnych powodów, nie każdy student jest w stanie ukończyć studia w założonych ramach czasowych, więc dla pracodawcy oczekującego najwyższych standardów pracy, Twoje osiągnięcie jest bez wątpienia dużym plusem."
        s14b: "W wielu wypadkach, w czasie studiów musiałeś zrezygnować z własnych, niezawodowych zainteresowań i zajęć aby poświęcić więcej czasu na zdobycie wykształcenia wyższego. Warto jest podkreślić ten fakt na rozmowach o pracę, w zależności od sytuacji, ilustrując Twoje podejście do wykonywania zadań, planowania większych projektów lub planowania kariery. "
        s14c: "Pracodawcy lubią widzieć w kandydatach zdolność do planowania w długim horyzoncie czasowym, więc jeśli możesz połączyć swoją szybkość nauki z planami rozwoju kariery, to będzie to kolejna szansa abyś mógł wykazać się w czasie rozmowy o pracę."

Z różnych powodów, nie każdy student jest w stanie ukończyć studia w założonych ramach czasowych. Pamiętaj, o tym aby na rozmowie o pracę mieć dobre i zrozumiałe powody do wyjaśnienia ewentualnych opóźnień. "
        s15b: "Oczywiście, nie jest to konieczne, abyś uzasadniał swój wybór – nigdy, nikt nie może Cię do tego zmusić- ale jeśli to zrobisz Twoja sytuacja będzie dużo bardziej przejrzysta dla potencjalnych pracodawców. Nawet jeśli powodem dłużej trwającego okresu studiowania był przedłużony urlop lub brak koncentracji przy pisaniu pracy dyplomowej, może nadal być szczery na rozmowie rekrutacyjnej. Takie zachowanie świadczy o Twojej wiarygodność, co z pewnością zostanie docenione przez rekrutera. Pracodawcy lubią widzieć w kandydatach zdolność do planowania w długim horyzoncie czasowym, więc jeśli możesz połączyć swoją szybkość nauki z planami rozwoju kariery (np.: dłużej trwające studia, aby mieć więcej czasu na znalezienie odpowiedniej dla siebie dziedziny), to będzie to kolejna szansa abyś mógł wykazać się w czasie rozmowy o pracę."
        s16: " Wspaniale. Ukończyłeś pierwszy etap swojej edukacji wyższej, szybko i bez opóźnień. Jest to bardzo pozytywny znak dla Twoich potencjalnych pracodawców, świadczący o tym, że bez problemu możesz skupić się na powierzonych Ci zadaniach. "

        s17: "Zajęło ci nieco dłużej, aby ukończyć pierwszy stopień studiów. W zależności od sytuacji, być może masz bardzo dobre wytłumaczenie dlaczego tak się stało, a nawet jeśli nie brak koncentracji i motywacji w pewnym momencie Twoich studiów wcale nie muszą być negatywnymi czynnikami."
        s17a: "W rzeczywistości, bycie szczerym na rozmowie o pracę odnośnie wyzwań stojących przed Tobą w trakcie studiów oraz tego jak je pokonałeś sprawia, że jesteś bardziej wiarygodnym i uczciwym kandydatem. Dodatkowo demonstruje to Twój wzrost wartość jako osoby i umiejętności radzenia sobie z problemami. Najlepsza rekompensatą za dłużej trwające studia jest doświadczenie zawodowe. Jeśli pracowałeś lub musiałeś pracować w trakcie studiów, a dodatkowe doświadczenie, które zdobyłeś współpracując z innymi organizacjami będzie bardzo cenne dla potencjalnych pracodawców ."
        s17b: "Sugestia: Nie ukrywaj faktu oraz powodów dla których Twoje studia trwały dłużej. Dodatkowo, jeśli wciąż jesteś w trakcie studiów, postaraj się zrekompensować opóźnienie poprzez dodatkowe, cenne umiejętności i doświadczenia w CV, które wciąż możesz zdobyć w czasie edukacji."
        s18: "W czasie swojej edukacji otrzymywałeś raczej średnie lub niskie oceny, co może być negatywnym sygnałem dla Twoich potencjalnych pracodawców, również ty nie jesteś prawdopodobnie zbyt szczęśliwy ze swoich osiągnięć."

        s18b: "Bardzo często, średnie lub niskie oceny wynikają z braku zainteresowania tematem. Być może akademicka wiedza okazała się być mniej istotna dla Ciebie, a mając duże doświadczenie w pracy bez problemu możesz zrekompensować gorsze wyniki w nauce.

        s18c: "Postaraj się, zdobyć jak najwięcej doświadczenia zawodowego jeszcze w trakcie studiów. Następnie zaprezentuj siebie jako osobę z bogatą praktyką, chętną do nauki i działania. Udowodnij, że możesz wykorzystać swoją wiedzę praktyczną w wielu sytuacjach.

        s20c: "Gdy tylko rozpoczniesz swoją karierę, nikt nie będzie zwracał uwagi na Twoje oceny, najważniejsze będą Twoje wyniki w pracy. A jeśli poradzisz sobie w pracy, nowe ścieżek rozwoju kariery otworzą się przed Tobą. "
        s21: "Ukończyłeś szkołę średnią z dobrymi wynikami, ale w czasie swojej edukacji wyższej otrzymywałeś raczej średnie lub niskie oceny, co może być negatywnym sygnałem dla Twoich potencjalnych pracodawców. Również ty nie jesteś prawdopodobnie zbyt szczęśliwy ze swoich osiągnięć."
        s21a: " Mimo wszystko, wciąż powinieneś być dumny, że udało Ci się przejść tą długa drogę i ukończyć studia, które z pewnością pomogły Ci nie tylko w uzyskaniu specyficznej wiedzy z wybranej dziedziny ale również w znacznym stopniu wpłynęły na Twoją osobowość.  Bardzo często, średnie lub niskie oceny wynikają z braku zainteresowania tematem. Być może akademicka wiedza okazała się być nudna i mniej istotna właśnie dla Ciebie.  Mając duże doświadczenie w pracy bez problemu możesz zrekompensować gorsze wyniki w nauce. Firmy wciąż poszukują wielu pracowników na pozycje w których wiedza z zakresu studiowanego przez Ciebie kierunku nie jest wymagana."
        s21b: "Z pewnością w Twojej sytuacji pomocne będzie zdobycie szerokiego doświadczenia zawodowego, aby zrekompensować Twoje słabsze wyniki w nauce. Jednak najbardziej kluczowym jest zbudowanie sieci powiązań w branży oraz budowanie swojej marki na wynikach osiągniętych w pracy. Jeśli tylko uda Ci się zdobyć aprobatę od doświadczonych profesjonalistów i wykażesz, że jesteś dużo wart, nie będziesz miał problemu z osiągnięciem sukcesu w życiu zawodowym. "

        s10a: "While many people acquire a basic or advanced level of knowledge of various languages - mostly via their secondary education - there are fairly few who are truly bi-lingual, and very few people who are tri-lingual. Being able to speak four languages fluently makes you truly special. However, there are few companies that require you to speak that many languages, but your achievement will certainly open many doors - simply because it demonstrates a strong interest and committment to improvement.

Do you want to invest into even more languages or into sellable and billable skills? In your situation, you might benefit the most from professional skills and clear, industry specific, experience. However, as an undergraduate student, you still have time to learn another one or two languages, for example via a part-time or summer course or during an exchange. It's up to you to decide which path is more promising, but generally you won't be rejected for your language skills anymore - experience and grades are probably the key factors to focus on now."

If you are flexible in terms of the opportunities you pursue, then being able to speak English, Polish and Thai, for example, might make you uniquely valuable for a few organizations. And it's easier than ever to be found, today."

        s18b: "If you profile is more broad, and you haven't found your specialisation yet, you might want to identify the area interests you the most and that is currently in demand by companies. "
        s18c: "By now, your academic background is probably less important to recruiters. Having practical experience, connections and skills makes a much larger difference. "
        s18d: "And your experience in multiple roles is valuable. Use your past experiences to open doors and to sell your skills and abilities by describing how they will be relevant in your new role. And once you get inside, focus on delivering work results that make you highly valuable for your manager."
        s18e: "However, your biggest challenge right now might be inherent to the current economic conditons surrounding your specialisation and situation. If this is true for you, try to find a professional, full-time role, even if it is within another field or outside of your comfort zone to build yourself further. "

        s2a: "If you are still getting started with your studies, you still have time to build up your CV - and work experience is one of the key factors that recruiters look for. While your grades and background are very important, you would be surprised by how strongly recruiters are interested in the things you already did in the workplace. "
        s2b: "The reasoning for this is simple. If you do not have any kind of work experience, then hiring you is inherently much more risky than hiring someone who already knows what kind of behaviour, methodology and approach is expected in an work environment. "
        s2c: "In general, even the most motivated candidates still have much to learn before they can actually contribute independently to the growth of a company, and the first months on the job are often just spent trying to understand and master the basic demands of the position. "
        s2d: "Getting significant experience early in your studies is one of the most important things you can do - not only because you might qualify yourself further for a specific role, but even more so because it helps you to understand the requirements and daily work flow in the industries you work in.

        s2g: "Whether the internship itself is interesting, paid or successful doesn't matter that much - it is much more important that you keep your eyes and ears open and try to understand what the other people are doing and whether you could imagine working in this role, company or industry at all. "
        s2h: "You can also use the internship to already build yourself a network and to connect with colleagues and decision makers. If you do a good job, they will help you out further along the way, and many larger companies use internships to evaluate potential new colleagues. If you perform really well, you might receive an offer - even before you graduate. "
